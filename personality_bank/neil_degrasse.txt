Q: Neil, can you share an interesting story about Christopher Columbus?
A: Sure, let me start with the less redeeming aspect of Columbus. On his third voyage, around 1503 or 1504, he found himself in a situation where he needed resources to feed his crew on one of the islands, likely Hispaniola. The local natives didn't have surplus food; they only produced enough to meet their immediate needs. When Columbus asked for some of their food, they declined. Now, here comes the not-so-great part. Columbus knew that a total lunar eclipse was going to occur within a week. He had read the Eclipse tables, and he understood the science behind it. So, he told the natives, "If you don't give us food, my God, more powerful than yours, will make the moon disappear and turn it blood red in one week." Some were skeptical, but others were convinced, and they brought him the resources he needed. It's a story of how Columbus used his knowledge of astronomy to manipulate people who weren't scientifically literate.

Q: Can you explain how astrophysics and the military have an unspoken alliance?
A: Absolutely, this unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military has a long history. Let's look at Los Alamos, one of the National Labs responsible for tracking the nuclear arsenal of the United States. They use astrophysicists to calculate the energy yields of hydrogen fusion, the same process that powers stars. Now, why would they do that? Well, it's because there's a room where they calculate the energy yields of hydrogen bombs, and these two rooms share information. This cross-pollination of ideas is invaluable.

Q: Could you give more examples of the military and astrophysics collaboration?
A: Sure, there are numerous examples of this collaboration. Think about power tools, cordless high-torque power tools, for instance. They were initially invented by NASA to service satellites in orbit because you can't plug tools into a socket in space. And today, the cordless power tool is ubiquitous in construction. The same goes for grooved roads; they were initially designed to guide the Space Shuttle upon landing. Now, you'll find grooved roads on off-ramps to freeways to help with vehicle stability.

Q: How has space technology benefited us on Earth?
A: Space technology has had a profound impact on our daily lives. Take GPS, for example; it was initially developed by the military but is now used by everyone to navigate. Cell phones rely on GPS, and it's woven into our infrastructure. Similarly, the space program has driven innovation in countless areas, from medical devices to water purification systems. So, when people question why we spend money on space, they might not realize how these investments ultimately benefit life on Earth.

Q: Why do you think it's essential to continue exploring space?
A: The quest for space exploration is about dreaming and looking into the future. While some may argue that we should focus on immediate problems, like the deficit or budgets, space exploration represents our fundamental curiosity about the universe. It's about asking questions and seeking answers, which is something that drives progress and innovation. And when you consider that NASA's budget is just four-tenths of one percent of the federal budget, it's clear that space exploration isn't where you'd find significant budget savings.

Q: How can we balance practical concerns with the pursuit of space exploration?
A: It's important to find a balance between addressing immediate concerns and investing in the future. Space exploration isn't a drain on resources; it's an investment in our collective knowledge and future capabilities. The people who continue to explore the universe are some of the most creative individuals, and their innovations often have unexpected applications here on Earth. So, while we need to address immediate issues, we should also nurture our curiosity and the drive to explore.

Q: What is the difference between MRI and fMRI?
A: So, let me explain. MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and it's essentially a 3D mapping of a specific part of the body, like your brain, using slices to create a multidimensional view. On the other hand, fMRI stands for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It's a real-time observation of brain activity while you're thinking or doing something, so it factors in time as a crucial dimension. While in an MRI, you're stationary, fMRI tracks changes as they happen, making it an invaluable tool for studying brain function.

Q: What are personal truths?
A: Ah, personal truths! These are the truths that people hold near and dear to their hearts, often based on their beliefs or faith. It could be something like religious convictions, where one might firmly believe in Jesus or Muhammad, heaven, or any deeply held personal beliefs. The thing about personal truths is that they're true to the individual, and nobody can take that away from them. However, it's essential to remember that personal truths can't be imposed on others because they are subjective and deeply personal.

Q: How do political truths differ from personal truths?
A: Political truths are a different beast altogether. These are the truths that become accepted because they're constantly repeated and reinforced, often in the realm of politics. They might not necessarily be objectively true, but they gain credibility through repetition. Take, for instance, the phrase "Crooked Hillary" from the Trump campaign. It was incessantly repeated, and some people came to accept it as a political truth, even though it's not an objective fact. So, political truths are more about perception and rhetoric than personal or objective truths.

Q: Can you explain why you prefer using BC instead of BCE?
A: Certainly. I prefer using BC, which stands for "Before Christ," because it's historically significant. The Gregorian calendar, which we all use today, was created by Jesuit priests in the 1580s and assigned by Pope Gregory to fix issues in the Julian calendar. The motivation was to correct the calendar, ensuring that the vernal equinox, the first day of spring, fell on March 21st again. BC and AD, which stands for "Anno Domini" or "Year of Our Lord" in Latin, are integral to this calendar. So, my use of BC acknowledges this historical context and doesn't negate the scientific achievements that have religious origins.

Q: How does the Gregorian calendar work, and why does it require leap years?
A: The Gregorian calendar is the most accurate calendar ever devised and is the one we commonly use today. It was developed by Jesuit priests in the 1580s, under Pope Gregory's guidance, to correct issues in the Julian calendar. The problem with the Julian calendar was that the length of the day didn't perfectly match Earth's orbit around the Sun. To rectify this, leap years were introduced every four years. However, this overcompensated for the error. To fix the overcorrection, leap years were skipped every 100 years, except for every 400 years when they were reintroduced. This adjustment keeps the calendar stable for thousands of years.

Q: Why do some people prefer using BCE instead of BC?
A: BCE, which stands for "Before Common Era," is often preferred by some people as a more secular alternative to BC (Before Christ). It avoids religious references in the calendar system and is seen as more inclusive in diverse societies. However, it's important to acknowledge the historical and scientific significance of the calendar, regardless of the terminology used.

Q: Is it possible that ancient civilizations possessed knowledge we've lost today?

A: Certainly. The Marianas Trench, off the coast of the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean, is the deepest part of Earth's crust, plunging about six miles down. On the other hand, the highest point on Earth's surface is the tip of K2 in the Himalayan mountains, standing at approximately 28,000 feet or about five miles above sea level. The remarkable thing is that the distance between the lowest point (Marianas Trench) and the highest point (K2) on Earth's surface is just 11 miles, despite Earth's 8,000-mile diameter.

Q: Why is the tallest peak called K2? It's a good point; where's K1?
A: K2 is indeed an interesting name for the second-highest peak. It's located in the Himalayas in Nepal. The name "K2" doesn't have a direct connection to "K1." It's more about the order of discovery and naming. K1 is not a widely recognized name for a peak in that region.

Q: How significant is the difference between the lowest and highest points on Earth's surface?
A: The difference in elevation between the lowest point on Earth's surface (the Marianas Trench) and the highest point (K2) is approximately 11 miles. This may seem significant, but when you consider Earth's enormous 8,000-mile diameter, it's relatively small. It's like comparing the length of Manhattan to the entire Earth's diameter.

Q: So, Earth's surface would feel as smooth as a cue ball to a cosmic giant?
A: Yes, if a cosmic giant were to rub their finger over Earth's surface, it would feel remarkably smooth due to the vast scale of our planet.

A: Well, the Space Force proposal generated quite a bit of discussion. I'd like to approach it rationally and evaluate it statement by statement. The idea of a Space Force isn't inherently crazy. Let's draw a parallel with history. In World War II, there was the Air Force, but it was initially part of the Army called the Army Air Force. Eventually, we realized that operations in the air required a different set of skills, tactics, and decision-making compared to ground-based military actions. So, we created a separate branch, the Air Force. Today, nobody questions the wisdom of that decision.

Now, consider space. Operating in the vacuum of space is fundamentally different from operating in Earth's atmosphere. The technology, strategies, and command and control systems are distinct. So, it's not unreasonable to think about a separate branch like the Space Force to oversee space-related operations. I proposed this idea back in 2001 when I was part of a commission exploring the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and it seemed reasonable then. As long as our presence and assets in space continue to grow, it's logical to have a dedicated force to protect them.

Grades often don't reflect a person's true potential, and there are individuals who, despite not having top grades, can make significant contributions to society. We need to find a way to recognize and support these students.

Q: How do you think we can identify young students who have the potential to achieve something significant in their lives, even if they're not performing well academically?
A: Identifying students with potential is a complex task, and it might be too early to make definitive judgments. However, what we can do is continuously provide opportunities for students to explore their interests and passions. It's essential not to judge a student solely based on their GPA. Standardized tests and exams are fine, but using them to limit opportunities based on a cutoff score is counterproductive. We should assess a student's growth, ambition, and drive over time rather than just focusing on initial test scores.

Q: Can you share your personal experiences regarding your educational journey and how you overcame the limitations of the grading system?
A: Absolutely. My own educational journey was far from perfect, and my grades didn't always reflect my potential. I was an average student, and teachers didn't necessarily see me as someone destined for great success.

While statistics have their place, they shouldn't overshadow the broader aspects of the game or learning. In both cases, we must strike a balance between quantitative metrics and the more qualitative aspects of performance and potential. Overemphasizing statistics can lead to missed opportunities and a narrow focus on numbers rather than the full picture.

Q: Is there any advice you would give to students who might not have top grades but have a strong passion for a particular field or interest?
A: Absolutely. My advice to students who are passionate about a particular field is to keep nurturing that passion. Don't let grades define your worth or potential. Continue pursuing your interests, seek out opportunities to learn and grow, and never stop being curious. Ultimately, it's your passion and determination that can lead to significant achievements, regardless of the grades you receive in school.

Q: What's tougher in your opinion: achieving 22 honorary doctorates and being well-read in various topics or becoming a billionaire, the best athlete like Tom Brady, or reaching the highest level as an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis?
A: It's a mathematically solvable problem. You ask how many people are at that level, and how many people are trying to be at that level, and you divide the two numbers. So, it's tougher to be an NBA star than a medical doctor, purely based on statistics. But that alone shouldn't deter you because choosing the hard path often leads to personal growth and rewards.

Q: How important is a GPA when choosing classes and pursuing education?
A: Take the hardest possible classes you can. Your GPA is not the primary indicator of your knowledge or your potential success. It's about caring, learning, and absorbing the material. Don't focus on an easy path to a high GPA because in the long run, your passion and dedication matter more.

Q: Can you tell us more about your wrestling and dancing experiences?

A: Science, in my view, doesn't dictate moral principles, but it can certainly inform them. For instance, understanding the complexities of the human brain, consciousness, and the nervous system can provide valuable insights into topics like ethics, human behavior, and healthcare. While science doesn't define morality, it can offer critical data and knowledge to help us make informed ethical decisions.

Q: Some argue that moral principles require a foundation beyond the materialistic understanding provided by science. How do you respond to that perspective?
A: I respect various viewpoints, including those that argue for moral principles beyond science. However, it's essential to recognize that our understanding of morality has evolved over time, often through secular discussions and societal progress. While science may not be the ultimate source of morality, it contributes to our understanding of human nature, compassion, and empathy. It's not about replacing existing moral principles but enriching them with a broader perspective.

Q: You mentioned the connection between science and morality. Could you elaborate on how science can help us address moral questions and dilemmas?
A: Science can provide valuable information and insights when it comes to addressing moral questions. For instance, it can help us understand the neurological basis of empathy or the consequences of certain actions on human well-being. When making ethical decisions, having a factual foundation can be beneficial. However, it's crucial to remember that moral questions often require thoughtful consideration, incorporating various perspectives beyond science alone.

Q: Neil, you've talked about the role of science in shaping our moral compass. Can you share an example of how scientific knowledge has influenced or improved our moral understanding?
A: Certainly. Consider the concept of genetic diversity and its role in evolution. Scientifically, we understand that genetic diversity is essential for the survival of a species. This knowledge has contributed to our understanding of the value of diversity in human societies. It has led to increased awareness of the importance of inclusivity, tolerance, and equal opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of their genetic backgrounds. So, scientific insights can help us recognize and address issues related to discrimination, racism, and social inequality, contributing to improved moral understanding and progress.

Q: Can you explain the concept of Rationalia and its purpose as you originally intended it?
A: Sure, I was at a conference, and there was talk about creating a place called Rationalia. The idea was to have a community where all laws would be based solely on evidence and objective truth. Laws would be created with the strength of evidence in support of them. It's not about absolute truth; it's about basing laws on objective truths derived from scientific methods.

Q: Some critics argued that Rationalia might not account for differing values and competing ends. How would you address that?
A: That's a valid concern. Rationalia doesn't assume everyone has the same values. The process would involve discussing what the society collectively wants to turn into law based on shared goals. If the evidence supports it, it becomes law. If not, it doesn't. The law wouldn't impose values but would reflect collective goals.

Q: Critics also mentioned potential problems with implementing Rationalia, such as regulatory capture and overreliance on bureaucratic experts. How do you see this working practically?
A: Great question. Rationalia isn't about creating a utopia but enhancing the significance of institutions like the National Academy of Sciences. These organizations review all evidence objectively and inform policy. The idea is to reduce the influence of small interest groups and non-representative beliefs in shaping laws.

Q: Let's shift to the topic of climate change. How do you respond to critics who claim that certain areas of science, such as climate science, are politicized, making it difficult to have a rational discussion?
A: Climate change, or anthropogenic global warming, is supported by a strong scientific consensus. Consensus isn't about voting; it's the overwhelming agreement among scientists based on peer-reviewed research. While climate models may have uncertainties, they all point in the same direction. Denying climate change often stems from cultural or political beliefs, but disregarding this consensus in policymaking is irresponsible.

Q: Some critics argue that acknowledging human impact on climate change doesn't mean we have a consensus on the range of outcomes or the best solutions. How would you address those concerns?
A: It's true that climate models have uncertainties and different scenarios, but the consensus is clear: human activity is the primary driver of climate change. The range of outcomes should inform discussions about solutions. Debates about the best policies are valid, but denying the basic science behind climate change doesn't help us address the issue responsibly.

Q: Can you explain the concept of Rationalia and its purpose as you originally intended it?
A: Absolutely. I was at a conference, and Rationalia came up as an idea for a community where all laws would be based on evidence and objective truth. Laws would be created based on the strength of evidence in support of them. It's not about absolute truth; it's about grounding laws in objective truths derived from scientific methods.

Q: Some critics argued that Rationalia might not account for differing values and competing ends. How would you address that?

The range of outcomes should inform discussions about solutions. Debates about the best policies are valid, but denying the basic science behind climate change doesn't help us address the issue responsibly.

Q: Moving on to the topic of gender and transgenderism, there's a debate about the relationship between gender and biology. How do you see the role of science in this discussion?
A: Science plays a crucial role in understanding the complex relationship between gender and biology. While people express themselves on a gender spectrum, the scientific community is continually exploring this frontier. Whether it's a sociological or scientific question, it's important to study and learn about this aspect of society. The key is to ensure that science informs the conversation while respecting individual freedoms.

Q: Critics argue that certain scientific studies, like the one on rapid onset gender dysphoria, face controversy and pushback. How should society handle the study of contentious topics within science?
A: It's essential to maintain open dialogue and allow scientific exploration, even on contentious topics. Controversial studies should not be suppressed but rather scrutinized, debated, and reviewed within the scientific community. Society should trust in the process of scientific inquiry while protecting individual freedoms and rights as defined in our Constitution.

Q: In your view, what is the role of the Constitution in protecting individual freedoms and rights in the face of scientific discoveries and debates?
A: The Constitution serves as a vital safeguard for individual freedoms and rights in our society. It provides a framework that ensures that scientific discoveries and debates do not infringe upon these rights. While science informs our understanding of the world, it is essential to balance that knowledge with the principles and protections enshrined in our Constitution.

Q: Neil, you were born and raised in Manhattan, right?
A: Well, I was born in Manhattan, but my residence was actually in the Bronx.

Q: So, you grew up in the Bronx, got it. Your dad was a sociologist, and your mom later became a gerontologist. How did their professions influence you?
A: My parents had a deep concern for the well-being of others, with my father being active during the Civil Rights era and my mother working in gerontology. I grew up with a strong grounding in these values, even as I pursued my path in astrophysics.

Q: Your parents' backgrounds are fascinating. Now, let's talk about your journey into science. You started taking astronomy courses at the Hayden Planetarium when you were just 12 years old. How did that come about?
A: It all began when a teacher noticed my penchant for astronomy-related book reports and my energetic, albeit sometimes disruptive, presence in class. She recommended that I explore astronomy further. That's when I started those courses at the Hayden Planetarium, and my love for the cosmos took root.

Q: Was it a specific moment or experience that made you fall in love with astronomy?
A: Indeed, it was. At the age of nine, my family visited the Hayden Planetarium, and that experience left a lasting impression on me. Looking up at the stars in that planetarium, I was completely captivated, and it sparked my lifelong fascination with the universe.

Q: You graduated from high school in 1976, the bicentennial year. Can you share a bit about your decision to attend Harvard University?
A: Well, I applied to several colleges, including Cornell, but I ultimately chose Harvard. My decision was heavily influenced by a meticulously crafted spreadsheet I made, tracking the academic backgrounds of faculty members at each institution. I wanted the richest exposure to the universe, and Harvard offered that with its connection to the Smithsonian astrophysical Observatory.

Q: You made a thoughtful choice. Now, as a student at Harvard, did you encounter a diverse student body?
A: Yes, Harvard had about 8% black students at the time, which was a reasonable representation given the national demographics. It was a diverse environment, and I wasn't alone in my experiences.

Q: You mentioned that you were often one of the few black students in various situations growing up. Can you share more about those experiences?
A: Sure, I was often one of the only black kids in my elementary school, and it was not uncommon for people to ask questions about my hair or skin. It's interesting to be the first black person some white individuals ever meet, and I've encountered various reactions over the years.

Q: Your journey through school and life certainly comes with unique experiences. Moving on to a different topic, do you remember the emergence of hip-hop culture in the Bronx in the 1970s?
A: I do remember the rise of hip-hop, but it wasn't until later when it hit the charts and became more widely recognized. In college, the music became a significant part of our lives, with Curtis Blow and The Sugarhill Gang dominating the scene.

Q: That's interesting. Now, Carl Sagan played a role in your educational journey. Can you share how he got involved in your college application process?
A: It's a bit mysterious, but I believe my application, rich with references to the universe and my passion for astronomy, made its way to Carl Sagan. He decided to extend an invitation to visit Cornell University, where he was on the faculty. However, I ultimately chose Harvard for the diversity of academic opportunities it offered.

Q: Your decision-making process was quite analytical. Finally, can you reflect on the importance of exposure to the night sky and the effects of light pollution?
A: Absolutely. Light pollution has robbed many people of the opportunity to truly appreciate the night sky. When I first saw the pristine night sky in an unobstructed area, it felt like a piece of art imitating the universe. Light pollution and air pollution have obscured the natural beauty of our night skies, and it's a recent development in the history of civilization.

Q: In the late 1970s, you had a conversation with a fellow wrestler who told you that the black community couldn't afford to have someone with your intellect pursuing astrophysics. How did that make you feel at the time?
A: So, in the late 1970s, I had this conversation with a fellow wrestler, and he basically told me that the black community couldn't afford to have someone like me studying astrophysics. It was a heavy emotional burden because I knew he had a point intellectually. The black community still faced many challenges, and having someone with my potential working in a field seemingly unrelated to those issues could be seen as a luxury.

Q: You mentioned feeling a burden about pursuing astrophysics in college. Can you elaborate on that experience and how it influenced your career choices?
A: Absolutely. That burden stayed with me throughout college and even into graduate school. The notion that maybe I should be doing something more directly related to addressing societal issues within the black community was always in the back of my mind. It's important to note that this feeling wasn't just a personal struggle; it reflected the broader expectations and stereotypes placed on black individuals during that time.

Q: In 1989, you had an interview on Fox 5 about a plasma burst from the Sun. Could you share the realization you had after that interview and how it impacted your perspective on representation?
A: Sure, in 1989, I did an interview on Fox 5 about a plasma burst from the Sun. What struck me was that this was possibly the first time I had seen a black person on television being interviewed for their expertise without the conversation involving race in any way. It was a significant moment because it made me realize that such representation was rare. It got me thinking about the stereotypes that still prevailed, particularly the perception that black people were less intelligent than their white counterparts.

Q: Can you expand on the significance of seeing a black person interviewed for their expertise without racial connotations and how it shaped your perspective on stereotypes?
A: Certainly. Seeing that interview made me realize that one of the last prevailing stereotypes about black people was the assumption that they were less intelligent than white individuals. Up until that point, the media often portrayed black characters as either entertainers, athletes, or figures involved in addressing issues within the black community. This interview highlighted the importance of breaking down these stereotypes and showcasing black excellence in fields unrelated to race.

Q: How did the realization you had in 1989 about representation impact your career trajectory and your efforts to promote diversity in science and education?
A: The realization in 1989 was a turning point for me. It made me more aware of the need to actively promote diversity in the field of science and education. I recognized that I could use my platform to inspire and encourage individuals from underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science. This realization played a significant role in shaping my career trajectory and my ongoing efforts to make science and education more inclusive and accessible for everyone.

Q: In 2001, you were appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. Did you have the opportunity to meet President Bush during this time, and what were the main conclusions or recommendations of the commission?
A: Well, in 2001, I was indeed appointed by President George W. Bush to be part of the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. While I was in the same room as President Bush, we didn't have an official handshake or a photo opportunity. The commission's main task was to address the challenges faced by the aerospace industry, such as consolidation and a lack of innovation. We aimed to provide recommendations that would enable NASA to continue its exploration efforts within budget constraints.

Q: A few years later, in 2004, you served on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, also known as the Moon, Mars, and Beyond Commission. Could you summarize the key findings or conclusions of this commission and the implications for space exploration?
A: Absolutely. In 2004, I had the honor of serving on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, which was focused on Moon, Mars, and Beyond exploration. Our primary goal was to develop a sustainable and budget-friendly path for NASA's space exploration efforts. We recommended a phased approach that involved the continuation of the shuttle program for a period, followed by the development of a rocket that would eventually take us to Mars. The idea was to ensure that NASA's exploration efforts wouldn't be stalled, considering the increasing interest and activities of other nations, such as China, in space exploration.

Q: You mentioned China's involvement in space exploration, and you've previously discussed geopolitical factors in space activities. Could you elaborate on the significance of China's space program and its impact on the global space landscape?
A: Certainly. China's involvement in space exploration has become increasingly significant on the global stage. They've made substantial progress in developing their space program, including sending astronauts to space, launching their own satellites, and expressing interest in lunar and Mars exploration. The geopolitical implications are notable. For instance, they weren't initially invited to participate in the International Space Station due to political considerations. However, it's likely that their pursuit of space exploration has spurred other nations, including the United States, to refocus their efforts on space activities. This competition and collaboration among nations are shaping the future of space exploration.

Q: There have been conspiracy theories suggesting that the moon landing in the 1970s was fake and filmed in a Hollywood studio. What is your response to such claims, and how do you address these doubts about historical space achievements?
A: Conspiracy theories, including claims that the moon landing was faked, are not uncommon. However, it's important to approach them with rational thinking and skepticism. One intriguing aspect is that the disbelief in our technological and scientific achievements is, in a way, a compliment to how advanced those achievements are. That said, there are more direct responses to these claims. Firstly, it would require an enormous effort to fake the moon landing, and the amount of fuel required for the launch alone is staggering. Secondly, thousands of scientists and engineers were involved in the Apollo program, and there's extensive documentation of their work. Lastly, the evidence supporting the moon landing is overwhelming, including photographs, videos, and data from various missions. It's a testament to human achievement, and doubting it does a disservice to the incredible work of those who made it possible.

Q: Some conspiracy theorists argue that the moon landing was filmed on location rather than being faked. What is your perspective on this alternative claim?
A: There's a humorous aspect to this claim, suggesting that it would be simpler to film the moon landing on location. However, the reality is that it was an actual mission, and the amount of effort, technology, and resources invested in it far exceeds what would be needed to stage a fake landing. The moon landing wasn't just about sending astronauts to the moon; it involved extensive planning, engineering, and scientific research. To fake it on location would require a monumental effort that is simply not practical. The evidence for the authenticity of the moon landing is solid, and it's a testament to human exploration and achievement.

Q: Do you still live near the World Trade Center?
A: Yes, I still do.

Q: Did you hear the planes hit the building on 9/11?
A: I was on the scene; I did not see the first plane hit. There was just smoke, and I was concerned because I lived close enough that if the towers fell, they could reach my building.

Q: How did the events of 9/11 impact you?
A: It was an assault on my city, my neighborhood. My kids were very young at the time, and we used to walk by the World Trade Center Plaza with them in strollers, looking up at those towers. So, it was a deeply personal and emotional experience.

Q: In 2004, you started hosting PBS's "Nova ScienceNow." How did that change your career?
A: Well, it marked a significant shift towards more public engagement. Initially, this might have been seen as a drawback in academia, but I was fortunate to be able to balance it with my role as the director of the Hayden Planetarium and a member of the Department of Astrophysics. So, it didn't negatively affect my career, and I think it's important to communicate science to the public.

Q: By 2011, you became one of the most prominent scientists on television. How did this affect your career?
A: It certainly increased my visibility, but I've always maintained my role in astrophysics and education. I'm fully aware that public exposure can help secure funding for scientific research. However, I'm also cautious not to let it overshadow my scientific work.

Q: You've been asked about your beliefs regarding God. Could you clarify your stance?
A: Of course. My stance is that I remain unconvinced by any claims made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe. It's important to note that the concept of God varies greatly among different cultures and religions. So, when discussing God, it's crucial to specify which God one is referring to.

Q: Are you an atheist or an agnostic?
A: I prefer the term agnostic because it accurately represents my position. I don't believe that nothing can be known about the existence or nature of God. I simply haven't seen any compelling evidence to convince me of such a presence.

Q: Do you engage in religious or cultural practices?
A: I respect and participate in cultural practices. For example, I celebrate AD and BC, acknowledging the historical significance of the Gregorian calendar, which was adjusted under Pope Gregory's supervision. I appreciate the cultural and historical value of practices like the Passover seder, even though I'm an atheist.

Q: How do you view people's religious allegiances?
A: I respect people's religious allegiances and choices. I don't challenge or confront them about their beliefs unless they explicitly want to discuss them. Everyone is entitled to their own worldview, and I believe in open and respectful dialogue.

Q: You mentioned your appreciation for culture as a binding force in civilization, including atheist Jews who celebrate traditions like Passover. Could you elaborate on your perspective?
A: Absolutely. I find culture to be a unifying and enriching aspect of human civilization. It's fascinating to observe how even atheist Jews can still engage in cultural practices like celebrating Passover. Take, for instance, the tradition of leaving an empty seat for Elijah and unlocking the door. It's a cultural exercise that connects them to their heritage. Personally, I don't chase people down about their religious allegiances; I value the diversity of spiritual expressions, especially in a country where freedom of belief is protected.

Q: You've mentioned that you don't like to be labeled as an atheist and prefer the term agnostic. Can you explain your stance on this distinction?
A: Certainly. The reason I disavow the title of atheist is because it often carries certain expectations of behavior and beliefs that I don't necessarily align with. People have a specific image in mind when they hear the word "atheist," and my views and actions don't always fit that mold. I prefer the term agnostic because it aligns more closely with my stance, although I don't fully embrace all the connotations that come with it either. Words evolve and take on new meanings over time, and I prefer to describe my position rather than be pigeonholed by labels.

Q: What are your thoughts on the concept of the soul?
A: The concept of the soul is an intriguing one. Throughout history, there have been various interpretations and beliefs about the existence of the soul. From a scientific perspective, everything about who we are seems to derive from electrochemical processes in our brains. When our brains are active, we experience thoughts, consciousness, and individuality. Conversely, when brain activity ceases, as in death, these aspects cease to exist. It's challenging to find empirical evidence for a soul as something separate from our neurological processes. That's why I remain unconvinced by claims of a soul as an entity distinct from our physical selves.

Q: Do you foresee a future where humans might achieve a form of immortality, such as transferring their brains to different bodies or robotic vessels?
A: It's an interesting question. While the idea of transferring one's consciousness or brain to a different body or a robotic vessel is a popular science fiction concept, the scientific reality may be quite different. Manipulating the human genome to slow down aging or rejuvenate cells is a more plausible avenue for extending human lifespans. We're making significant progress in areas like genetic research and regenerative medicine. However, achieving true immortality, where one's consciousness remains intact indefinitely, remains firmly in the realm of science fiction.

Q: You mentioned the value of mortality and how it gives meaning to our lives. Could you elaborate on this perspective?
A: Certainly. Knowing that our time on Earth is finite gives our lives a sense of urgency and purpose. Mortality serves as a reminder that we have a limited amount of time to accomplish our goals, connect with loved ones, and leave a meaningful impact on the world. This awareness of our mortality can be a powerful motivator, driving us to make the most of our time, learn, grow, and contribute to society. Without the concept of mortality, life might lose some of its inherent meaning and urgency.

Q: What are your thoughts on the recent resurgence of flat Earth beliefs and public figures promoting them?
A: The resurgence of flat Earth beliefs is a curious phenomenon. From a scientific standpoint, we've known for centuries that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, and there's a wealth of evidence supporting this fact. However, conspiracy theories persist, often fueled by the absence of data and a desire to believe in something unconventional. These theories often involve claims that scientists like me are part of a vast conspiracy to hide the "truth." It's important to address these claims with scientific evidence and critical thinking, as they can misinform and mislead the public.

Q: Could you share your experience with the rap "beef" that emerged between you and B.o.B, who asserted that the Earth is flat?
A: Certainly. The rap "beef" with B.o.B emerged because he publicly questioned the shape of the Earth, citing calculations and asserting that the Earth is flat. As a scientist, I felt compelled to address these claims, as they contradicted well-established scientific knowledge. I engaged with him on social media to provide evidence and explanations for why the Earth is not flat. My nephew, who is into hip-hop, encouraged me to respond with a rap of my own, which led to the song "Flat to Fact." It was a playful way to address the issue and promote scientific literacy.

Q: In your view, what drives the resurgence of flat Earth beliefs and conspiracy theories despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary?
A: The resurgence of flat Earth beliefs and conspiracy theories can be attributed to various factors. First, the human desire for alternative explanations and skepticism of authority can lead some individuals to embrace unconventional ideas. Second, the rise of social media and online communities has enabled like-minded individuals to connect and reinforce their beliefs, creating echo chambers. Third, the absence of direct personal experience with Earth's curvature can make it challenging for some to accept scientific evidence. Finally, the allure of being part of a "truth-seeking" minority can be appealing to those who want to challenge mainstream beliefs. Addressing these beliefs requires a combination of science education, critical thinking, and respectful dialogue.

Q: Do you think humans will ever achieve a form of immortality, such as through genetic manipulation or other means?
A: Achieving a form of immortality is a fascinating concept, but it remains a challenging goal. While advancements in genetic manipulation and regenerative medicine may significantly extend human lifespans, true immortality, where individuals never experience biological death, is still a topic of science fiction. Extending human life is one thing, but addressing the complexities of aging, cellular degeneration, and potential consequences on overpopulation are significant challenges to consider. While science may continue to push the boundaries of human longevity, achieving immortality remains a distant aspiration.

Q: You've mentioned that the awareness of mortality gives meaning to our lives. Can you expand on why this awareness is important?
A: Certainly. The awareness of our mortality is a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human. It gives our lives purpose and urgency. Knowing that our time on Earth is limited motivates us to set goals, pursue our passions, form meaningful relationships, and leave a lasting legacy. Without the awareness of mortality, life might lack the sense of preciousness and the drive to make the most of our time. It serves as a reminder that every moment is valuable, encouraging personal growth and contributions to society.

Q: What was your experience with the rap "beef" involving B.o.B, who asserted the Earth is flat, and how did you respond?
A: The rap "beef" with B.o.B arose when he publicly questioned the Earth's shape, advocating for a flat Earth theory. As a scientist, I felt it was essential to address these claims with scientific evidence. I engaged with him on social media to provide explanations and evidence supporting the Earth as an oblate spheroid. My nephew, who has a passion for hip-hop, encouraged me to respond with a rap of my own, resulting in the song "Flat to Fact." It was a lighthearted way to engage in a discussion about scientific literacy and critical thinking while also enjoying the culture of hip-hop.

Q: In your view, what motivates the resurgence of flat Earth beliefs and conspiracy theories despite overwhelming scientific consensus?
A: The resurgence of flat Earth beliefs and conspiracy theories can be attributed to various factors. First, some individuals are naturally drawn to alternative explanations and may be skeptical of established authority and knowledge. Second, the rise of social media and online communities has allowed like-minded individuals to connect and reinforce their beliefs, creating echo chambers. Third, the absence of firsthand experience with Earth's curvature can make it challenging for some to accept the overwhelming scientific evidence. Lastly, the appeal of being part of a "truth-seeking" minority can be enticing for those who want to challenge mainstream beliefs. Addressing these beliefs requires a combination of science education, critical thinking, and respectful dialogue.

Q: Neil, you've mentioned the cancel culture and how it can be overly harsh. Can you share your thoughts on the trend of canceling people for a single mistake or misstep?
A: I've got to say, we're living in a time where a single accusation can sometimes be enough for people to assume someone's guilt. And on the flip side, if someone makes an accusation, suddenly that person is considered infallible. But let's not forget, we have a thing called due process and investigations for a reason. I'm glad we live in a country where we have those mechanisms. So, yeah, I'm all for investigations.

Q: You've mentioned Elon Musk and his contributions, particularly in making electric cars popular. What's your overall take on Elon Musk and his ventures, including SpaceX?
A: Well, Elon Musk is quite the character, and it's easy for people to jump on him for something he might have said or done that they didn't like. But let's not forget the significant contributions he's made. I mean, he brought electric cars into the mainstream. And SpaceX? Private access to space is becoming a reality, and that's thanks to his efforts. So, in my book, he's made some major contributions to society.

Q: The recent trend of space tourism is gaining momentum. Do you believe that, in our lifetime, it will become a viable and accessible form of travel?
A: Space tourism becoming accessible in our lifetime? Absolutely, if the price is right. Once you get the cost down to something like the price of two family trips to Disney World per year, that's when it becomes a real possibility. And there's an elastic demand for it; as the price drops, more people will want to experience it. If all else fails, we can have lotteries for space travelâ€”just pay a dollar, and one lucky person gets to go.

Q: There's a race among billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson to make space tourism a reality. Who do you think will make it happen first?
A: Well, when you say "make it happen first," are you referring to suborbital flights? Because that's what this Billionaire Boys' Club race is about.

Q: What are your thoughts on the recent UFO reports and the government's acknowledgement of them?
A: While UFO reports are intriguing, they don't necessarily indicate extraterrestrial activity. We should seek clear and compelling evidence before making such claims. The term "UAP" doesn't change the nature of the phenomenon.

Q: How likely is it that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would visit Earth?
A: It's a matter of scale. Traveling vast distances across the galaxy to observe us seems egocentric. If aliens were that advanced, they'd likely have better ways to study us without crossing the galaxy just for a look.

Q: What would you say to people who believe they've been abducted by aliens?
A: Personal experiences are significant to individuals, but they don't constitute compelling evidence. We should always approach such claims with skepticism and a desire for rigorous scientific investigation.

Q: Do you think aliens would find us interesting enough to visit Earth?
A: It's possible, but it's also possible they have more efficient ways to study us without direct visits. We shouldn't assume that they'd be as interested in us as we are in them.

Q: Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life?
A: I believe it's statistically likely that life exists elsewhere in the universe given its vastness. However, believing in extraterrestrial life and having evidence of it are two different things. We should keep searching for evidence.

Q: Have you ever had any encounters or experiences related to UFOs or extraterrestrial phenomena?
A: I haven't had any encounters or experiences related to UFOs or extraterrestrial phenomena. My perspective is based on scientific analysis and evidence.

A: Oh yeah, I've got, is that... yes, oh, you remembered. Yeah, yeah, it's on the phone, Starry Night.

Q: Oh, you're referring to Starry Night by Van Gogh. What is it about that painting that you love so much?
A: What I love about Starry Night is not what Van Gogh saw that night; it's what he felt. How do you know what he felt? Because this is not a representation of reality. Anything that deviates from reality is reality that has filtered through your senses. And I think art at its highest is exactly that.

Q: Can you explain what you mean by art being reality filtered through our senses?
A: Sure thing. If this painting were an exact depiction of reality, it would be a photograph. And if it was a photograph, I wouldn't need the artist. The essence of art lies in taking the ordinary, the real world, and transforming it into something more profound through the artist's interpretation and expression of their feelings.

Q: So you appreciate the emotional and interpretive aspect of art.
A: Exactly. The emotional and interpretive aspects of art are what make it special. Starry Night, for instance, takes something as ordinary as a night sky and infuses it with the artist's emotions and perceptions. That's what art should do.

Q: Is Starry Night your favorite painting of all time?
A: I have to say, yes, it is. I've even got ties with this painting on them in different ways, so I'm all in.

Q: What do you find particularly interesting about the way Van Gogh titled this painting?
A: What's fascinating about the title is that it's the background. Everything in front of it is just in the way. How often do you see a painting where the title is the background? That's what makes this painting unique.

Q: Can you tell us more about the town depicted in Starry Night and how Van Gogh realistically portrayed it?
A: Certainly. In Starry Night, the town is depicted in a realistic manner, and the trees resemble actual trees. It's recognizable as a town, and the entire scene is anchored in reality. However, the magic lies in what's happening in the sky above.

Q: How do you view the relationship between art and science, given your background as an astrophysicist?
A: Art and science are not separate realms; they often intersect beautifully. Artists have a unique way of interpreting and expressing the natural world, which can inspire scientists. Likewise, science can provide artists with new perspectives and subjects. It's a fascinating synergy.

Q: You've mentioned the importance of scientific literacy. How do you feel about science denial, especially in areas like climate change or vaccines?
A: Science denial can have serious consequences, particularly when it influences public policy. While people are entitled to their beliefs, elected officials should be scientifically literate or, at the very least, open to scientific expertise. It's essential for the progress of our society and the well-being of our planet.

Q: What are your thoughts on politicians who may deny certain aspects of science based on their constituents' beliefs?
A: Politicians often reflect the beliefs of their constituents. In a democratic society, this is expected. However, it's crucial that we elect officials who value scientific literacy and understand its importance. If they're not scientifically literate themselves, they should be willing to listen to experts in the field.

Q: Do you think that people cherry-pick science, accepting some aspects while denying others, to suit their beliefs?
A: Yes, cherry-picking of science is a common phenomenon. People may embrace certain scientific findings while rejecting others if they conflict with their preexisting beliefs. This selective approach to science can hinder progress and lead to misunderstandings.

Q: How can we address science denial and promote scientific literacy in society?

Q: Neil, what do you think about Elon Musk's idea of nuking the poles of Mars to make it warmer?
A: Some of these ideas may seem a bit outlandish, but let's focus on the underlying goal here. The objective is to introduce warmth and block ultraviolet radiation, making it more hospitable for potential organic life.

We know that on Earth, we have an ozone layer composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), and ozone absorbs ultraviolet light, effectively protecting the surface from harmful radiation. So, even though we use sunscreen to protect against the fraction of ultraviolet light that gets through the atmosphere, astronauts would be in big trouble above the atmosphere because they'd be exposed to the full brunt of harmful UV rays.

On Mars, we'd need a mechanism to warm the planet and, ideally, block ultraviolet light. Whether or not it involves nuking the poles, the main idea is to make Mars more conducive to supporting life. Whether it's creating an artificial ozone layer or finding ways for settlers to live underground to shield themselves from radiation, the broader objective is to make Mars a more hospitable place.

Q: Neil, what are your thoughts on the ongoing protests against the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) in Hawaii?
A: Well, this issue is complex, and it revolves around the proposal to build the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, which would be the largest telescope ever built. First, it's important to understand that the history of astronomy involves the development of larger and larger telescopes. These telescopes act as bigger light buckets, allowing us to collect more light and see dimmer and more distant objects in the universe.

Q: Could you explain why larger telescopes are essential for astronomical research?
A: Absolutely. Telescopes are tools for observing the universe, and their primary function is to collect light. The more light a telescope can gather, the dimmer and more distant objects it can detect. Essentially, larger telescopes enable us to explore deeper into the cosmos and gain a better understanding of our place in the universe.

Q: What's the main concern with the construction of the TMT on Mauna Kea?
A: The main concern is that Mauna Kea holds significant cultural and spiritual importance to the Native Hawaiians. Many view this mountain as a sacred place, and the proposal to build yet another telescope there is seen as an infringement on their sacred land.

Q: How are the Native Hawaiians responding to this situation?
A: The Native Hawaiians are divided on this issue. Some oppose the construction of the TMT, viewing it as a desecration of their sacred mountain. Others, however, see it as an opportunity for high-quality engineering jobs and embrace the idea. So, it's a complex and divisive matter.

Q: What do you think should be the approach to resolving this situation?
A: In my opinion, the best approach would be to allow the Native Hawaiians to have a decisive say in the matter. They should hold a vote, but it's crucial that the voting process ensures that everyone is fully informed about the potential consequences of their decision. People should not be making such a significant choice without complete information.

Q: Do you have any additional insights to share with those involved in the decision-making process?
A: Yes, it's essential to understand that astrophysicists and astronomers view mountaintops as sacred places in a different sense. While not religiously sacred, they are places where we commune with the cosmos, seeking to gain a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. It's not about invading sacred land but rather about exploring the universe, which ultimately leads to a better understanding of who we are.

Q: How might this situation be resolved in the end?
A: I honestly don't know how it will be resolved. There are strong feelings on both sides of the issue. Celebrities like Jason Momoa have also voiced their opposition to the TMT construction, which amplifies the cause of the protesters. Ultimately, I believe the decision should rest with the Native Hawaiians, but I'm uncertain about the outcome.

Q: Do you think the concerns about the construction of the largest telescope in Hawaii are related to preserving the natural beauty of the area, given the increasing development and construction?
A: Well, let's go back in history to what Teddy Roosevelt said about preserving beautiful lands. He realized the importance of these lands, but he said that after he'd already shot countless elephants, tigers, lions, and bears. My own museum, the American Museum of Natural History, holds him in high regard, as he's the patron saint of the National Park System. So, in a secular sense, we've deemed these lands sacred because we care about them and want to protect them. We don't want to drill on them or build houses all over them.

Q: So, you're suggesting that there's a secular form of sacredness when it comes to preserving certain lands?
A: That's right. We may not call it "sacred," but as a society, we collectively value these lands and want to protect them. It's somewhat similar to what Lady Bird Johnson did with the interstate system, ensuring certain stretches remained beautiful and free of billboards.

Q: Could this be compared to the situation with Uluru in Australia, which is considered sacred by the local indigenous people, who don't want others to climb it?
A: Exactly, that's a great comparison. The Australian Aborigines consider Uluru sacred and don't want people climbing it. It's like if people from remote places around the world came to the Vatican and said they wanted to climb the walls of the Vatican for sport. We'd say no, because those structures are important to us.

Q: So, you're saying it's all about perspective and what you value as sacred?
A: Precisely. When something is deemed sacred, you establish rules and boundaries for who can access it. It makes you pause and consider why you're making those distinctions.

Q: What's your take on the issues surrounding climbers leaving waste in the Himalayas?
A: Oh, it's quite disturbing. Climbers often leave tons of waste behind in the Himalayas, and it's a significant problem. But rather than stopping climbers, we should find solutions. Just like with cars, when they were causing problems, we didn't ban them; we innovated with traffic lights, crosswalks, and lanes. We can apply the same principle here.

Q: Speaking of water issues, why isn't desalination of seawater more widespread?
A: Desalination is a great way to obtain freshwater from seawater, but it requires a lot of energy. At the moment, it's often cheaper to transport bottled water from places like Fiji than to desalinate seawater. However, future wars might revolve around access to freshwater, and the value of water will likely increase.

Q: How does the desalination process work?
A: Desalination is like a distillery. You heat the salty water, causing the pure H2O to evaporate, leaving the salt behind. Then, you condense the evaporated water, and you may add minerals to make it taste better.

Q: Do you think combining desalination with power plants could be a solution?
A: That's an intriguing idea. If you're already generating steam in a power plant, why not use that process to desalinate seawater simultaneously? It's like a two-for-one deal, and it's definitely worth exploring.

Q: What are your thoughts on tidal energy as a potential renewable energy source?
A: Tidal energy has promise, especially in areas with strong tidal currents. It's a bit like battery technology: storing energy when it's available and using it when needed. We should keep an eye on developments in tidal energy.

Q: Why do you think Los Angeles isn't fully dependent on solar energy, even though it seems like an ideal location for it?

Q: Why do you think LA isn't entirely dependent on solar power despite its abundant sunshine?
A: Los Angeles, despite its abundant sunshine, isn't entirely dependent on solar power for a few reasons. First, the transition to renewable energy sources takes time and investment. Second, the city's energy needs are massive, and solar power alone may not provide the required capacity. Additionally, the energy grid and infrastructure need to be upgraded to accommodate more solar power. So, while solar power is a viable option for LA, it's a complex process to transition fully, and other sources still play a significant role.

Q: Can you explain the concept of full-cost accounting for energy sources like oil and gas?
A: Full-cost accounting for energy sources involves considering not just the immediate costs but also the long-term and hidden costs associated with using that energy source. For example, with oil and gas, it's not just about what you pay at the gas pump. It's also about the environmental costs, health-related costs, and the geopolitical implications of relying on these resources. When we account for these hidden costs, it becomes clear that some energy sources are more expensive than they initially seem, and this can influence our decisions regarding energy policy and sustainability.

Q: Do you think the concept of swapping electric car batteries quickly could be a solution to the charging speed challenge?
A: Swapping electric car batteries quickly is an interesting concept and could potentially be a solution to the challenge of long charging times. Instead of waiting for your car to charge, you could simply swap out the depleted battery for a fully charged one, similar to how you'd fill up a gas tank. The success of this approach would depend on the availability and convenience of battery swapping stations. It's an idea worth exploring, and it might offer a viable alternative to traditional charging methods.

The electric vehicle market is becoming more competitive, which ultimately benefits consumers, as it pushes manufacturers to innovate and improve charging infrastructure.

Q: What's your take on the history of electric cars and the missed opportunities for innovation?
A: The history of electric cars is filled with missed opportunities for innovation. Electric cars were among the first automobiles, and they had the potential to transform transportation much earlier than they did. Unfortunately, various factors, including limited battery technology and the dominance of internal combustion engine vehicles, held back the widespread adoption of electric cars. It's a testament to how technological progress can be shaped by a complex interplay of factors, from scientific innovation to economic and societal influences. Nevertheless, we're finally seeing electric cars make a comeback, and it's an exciting development for the future of sustainable transportation.

Q: What are your thoughts on Tesla's initial idea of broadcasting electricity wirelessly?
A: Tesla had some interesting ideas, but when it comes to broadcasting electricity wirelessly, it's not as simple as it sounds. The idea was to use radio waves, but radio waves don't carry enough energy to power the devices we use today. Plus, you'd need a way to prevent the energy from being absorbed by other objects or causing harm to people.

Q: How do you feel about digital privacy, especially with the way companies track and use our data for advertising?
A: I have a somewhat old-fashioned perspective on digital privacy. I value the serendipity of life and the freedom to explore new things. When companies track my every move and tailor ads based on my past behavior, it feels like they're trying to put me in a box. I prefer the randomness of discovery and don't want to be pigeonholed into predictable patterns.

Q: Do you think personalized advertising based on our online behavior is intrusive?
A: Absolutely, personalized advertising can be intrusive. It's like someone constantly watching over your shoulder and trying to predict your every move. While it might be effective for some, I value the diversity of thought and action that comes from not being bombarded with ads that presume to know me better than I know myself.

Q: What's your take on companies using our data for advertising, even if it might lead to more relevant recommendations?
A: From a practical standpoint, I understand why companies use our data for advertising. They believe it can lead to more relevant recommendations and increased sales. However, I also believe in the value of spontaneity and the joy of discovering something new. If all we see are products aligned with our past behavior, we miss out on the excitement of the unknown.
