##Q: How do you view the energy around pop music?
A: There's a misconception that pop music lacks emotional depth, but that's not true. I discussed this with Julie Greenwald. While "Bad Habits" is danceable and fun, songs like "Eyes Closed" resonate on a deeper level. An artist needs a diverse range of songs to connect with various emotions.

A: "Eyes Closed" carries intense emotions, a sense of connectivity, sadness, and rawness. I felt so strongly about it that I cried the first time I performed it live.

##Q: How do you navigate between different types of songs in your live shows?
A: The goal is to create a dynamic experience for the audience. One moment might be a perfect connection through a song like "Eyes Closed," while the next might be a fun song like "Bad Habits." The variety captures different moments and emotions, making the performance more interesting.

##Q: Has your journey taken a different trajectory with the album "Subtract"?
A: Indeed, there's a beautiful arc to my journey, and "Subtract" adds depth. Continuously creating hits isn't sustainable. I sensed this around the time of the "Collaborations Project." While I'd explored different genres, fans still had a distinct connection to my original records.

##Q: Did you feel a need to return to your roots?
A: Absolutely, as with "Life Lived." Back then, I aimed to be a singer-songwriter like Damien Rice, but you can't achieve that depth at a young age. Also, I didn't want my career to be predictable. Rediscovering my original passion felt different this time due to Aaron's influence.

##Q: How did working with Aaron change your perspective?
A: Collaborating with Aaron shifted my focus. I added emotion, melody, and lyrics to his music, stepping out of my usual process. This fresh approach allowed me to concentrate on one aspect and create heartfelt songs.

##Q: How do you view the diversity of your albums?
A: Each album has its mood, feel, and approach. "Boat," the first track on the album, showcases a different perspective on life. My approach to songwriting changes over time, but it's all filtered through my lens of writing songs.

##Q: What about "Eyes Closed" and its impact on your fans?

A: Success shouldn't hinder honesty in art. I've navigated ups and downs and struggled with my mental health. Sharing my journey is about acknowledging that no amount of success can replace personal losses.

A: Success sometimes leads to a disconnect between an artist's public persona and their private struggles. The pressure to maintain a positive image can hinder honest conversations about mental health and challenges.

##Q: Can you talk about your experience in court during a difficult time?
A: The courtroom experience was challenging. While others discussed their struggles, I had to maintain composure despite the fact that I was facing personal hardships. It highlighted the lack of recognition of my humanity.

##Q: How does this album embody your journey towards authenticity?
A: This album reflects my journey in embracing honesty and discomfort. I've been obsessed with projecting a certain image, but this album strips away the facade and presents me as I am.

##Q: How has being honest in this interview and your music affected your sense of visibility?
A: Sharing my vulnerabilities has made me feel more visible in a way. By opening up and standing alongside others, I've shown that I'm just as human as anyone else.

##Q: Do you feel more connected to others now that you've revealed your true self?
A: Revealing my true self has made me feel more connected to humanity. It's freeing to be honest and share my experiences, even if they're uncomfortable or unconventional.

##Q: What message do you hope listeners take from your album and this conversation?
A: I hope that people see my album and this conversation as an opportunity for connection. I'm not a distant pop figure; I'm a human being with flaws and growth, and I want people to relate to that.

##Q: How do you feel about being open and honest in this interview?
A: Being open and honest is liberating. It's freeing to share my thoughts and experiences without worrying about how they'll be sensationalized. I hope it drives people to listen to the album.

##Q: Can you discuss your growth as an individual and how it reflects in your music?
A: My growth is ongoing, and this album is a reflection of that. Embracing discomfort and being authentic is a constant journey, and it's something I've poured into my music.

##Q: How do you view the power of being genuine in a world that expects perfection?
A: Authenticity is powerful because it breaks the illusion of perfection. As an artist, it's important for me to convey that I'm a real person with real struggles, and I hope that resonates with others.

##Q: How has fatherhood changed your routines and lifestyle?
A: It's shifted things quite a bit. The first three months were a whirlwind, but I've adjusted to a new normal. Now, I wake up at 2:30 AM, have playtime, and fit naps wherever I can. My daughter is in a routine now, sleeping at 7 PM and waking around 5 AM.

##Q: Do you travel with your daughter often?
A: I'd like to, but I took her to LA and New York for promotional work once. However, jetlag was tough on her. So, now I try to avoid trips that could mess up her sleep pattern, but I've never been away from her for more than about eight days.

##Q: How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact you and your daughter?
A: My wife was pregnant before the pandemic, so we were cautious. We avoided contact with others to protect her. When my daughter and I got COVID-19, it wasn't severe, but it affected sleep, caused fever, diarrhea, and coughing. She had it twice.

##Q: How do you manage your daughter's body clock while in America?
A: Her body clock is on the early side, waking up around 4 AM. We have a routine involving limited screen time, particularly shows like "Paw Patrol" that she loves. I aim to keep her engaged without overexposing her to screens.

##Q: Could you discuss the nighttime routine you've established for your daughter?
A: Her routine has evolved. She used to wake up at random times, but now we've introduced sleep training. At 7 PM, she's in bed with a bottle. She sleeps through the night without waking up much, maybe once for a change.

##Q: How did becoming a father influence your songwriting?
A: When I found out I was becoming a dad, I was inspired to write lullabies. I ended up writing about 50 songs like that, filled with excitement. Some songs were written before she was born, and one specific lullaby was written after her birth.

##Q: Did the song you wrote for your daughter match your expectations?
A: Yes, the lullaby I wrote works as intended. It's calming, and I play it for her. I wanted to have a song that she could connect to, and it seems to resonate with her.

##Q: Do you think about future children and their potential songs?
A: I've written many lullabies, but I can't just pretend a song I wrote for one child is for another. Each child will have their own special songs and experiences. It's an interesting challenge.

##Q: How does fatherhood align with your creative process?
A: Fatherhood has inspired a lot of creativity in me. Writing lullabies and songs related to my experiences as a dad has been natural and fulfilling. It's a unique aspect of my creative journey.

##Q: How did you navigate having multiple children who want individual items?
A: My kids are similar in age, so they want similar things. They'll argue if they don't get the same item, so we usually ensure they each have their own. It's a balancing act between sharing and individuality.

##Q: What do you find unique about the parenting experiences of kids of different ages?
A: Older kids, like 19 and 17, have distinct preferences and aren't as focused on having the same things. But younger ones, aged 8, 7, and 5, want everything to be equal. If one does something, they all want to do it.

##Q: Can you discuss the balance between being a dad and maintaining your career?
A: It's all about finding balance. My approach is to include my family in my career when possible, but also respect their needs and routines. Being a dad is a significant part of who I am, and I incorporate that into my work-life balance.

##Q: Did your relationship with your older brother influence your interests?
A: Definitely, during our teenage years, there was some frustration because I was drawn to things he was passionate about. I admired him a lot, and sometimes he thought I was doing it just to annoy him. But in reality, I looked up to him and wanted to be like him.

##Q: How did the age difference between you and your brother play into this dynamic?
A: The age difference was two years. In our school, siblings were usually in the same year, so it was different for us. We ended up hanging out together with friends who were also siblings, creating a unique dynamic.

##Q: You mentioned slowing down drinking and adopting healthier habits. Could you elaborate?
A: Absolutely, I've significantly reduced my drinking and even cut out certain things. Occasionally, I smoke a cigarette, but it's infrequent. I lost a lot of weight, started feeling better, and wanted to live healthier, especially for my baby and to feel more confident.

##Q: How did the weight loss and healthier lifestyle connect to your role as a father?
A: It was a domino effect. By cutting out certain habits, I started feeling better, waking up earlier, exercising, and gaining self-confidence. It became a positive cycle that led to healthier habits and a better mindset.

##Q: Are you aiming for a certain physical appearance or lifestyle?
A: I don't have a specific goal, like being shirtless and muscular. I did a topless scene in the "Shape of You" video to showcase my weight loss progress. However, my main motivation was feeling better, being healthier, and having the energy to embrace each day.

##Q: How has this lifestyle change influenced your songwriting?
A: The album I've worked on is less focused on messy breakups and more about relationships within my family and personal experiences. It reflects my life as a dad and a husband, creating a more wholesome feel.

##Q: In "Bad Habits," you mention dreams about a bullet in your head. Did you analyze the meaning behind that?
A: I had recurring dreams where I lost my teeth, often linked to anxiety and change. These dreams seemed to predict major shifts in my life. Dreams can be tied to emotions, and for me, they seemed to correlate with upcoming changes.

##Q: How do personal experiences, like the dream mentioned, influence your songwriting?
A: Songwriting is a vulnerable process, and if you're not slightly embarrassed by what you're writing, it might not be genuine. The best songs often come from moments of doubt, shame, and discomfort. That's where the magic happens.

##Q: You mentioned in a previous interview that you thought you were gay when you were younger. Can you clarify?
A: I'm open about my interests, and growing up, I had interests that some at my school would tease me about. However, I don't want to perpetuate stereotypes. I respect everyone's individuality and don't think interests should be limited by stereotypes.

##Q: How do you deal with being misquoted or misunderstood in the media?
A: It's frustrating when things are taken out of context and blown out of proportion on social media. But I still do interviews because it's important for people to get to know the real me, even if sometimes I slip up and have to clarify my intentions later.

##Q: Can you discuss the song "Visiting Hours" and the concept of communicating with those who have passed away?
A: "Visiting Hours" is about a mentor who had a great sense of humor. He once offered to buy me anything I wanted, so I asked for a bronze statue of him holding a wine glass. We made statues of each other. The song is about wanting advice from him, as if he were still here.

##Q: Do you ever have conversations in your head with people who are no longer here?
A: The inspiration for "Visiting Hours" came from a desire to have conversations with my late mentor. It's a natural human instinct to wish we could still communicate with those who've passed away.

##Q: How do your personal experiences and emotions influence your songwriting?
A: Songwriting is a vulnerable process, and I'm open about my experiences and emotions. I feel a bit weird discussing personal matters in songs because it leads to discussing them in interviews. But that's the nature of creating authentic music.

##Q: How does your music reflect your growth and evolving experiences?
A: My music is a reflection of my journey, growth, and experiences. Each album captures a moment in time and the changes I've gone through. As an artist, I strive to be authentic and honest with my audience.

##Q: Could you share the story behind the statue of your late friend?
"A: It might seem strange, but I have a statue of my late friend in my pub. When I want to talk to him, I go there, pour a glass of wine for him, and we have a conversation. I even celebrated my release night with him. It's comforting and helps me feel connected."

##Q: Have you ever felt like he's responding or communicating back?
"A: It's an emotional topic. I've had moments when I've felt his presence, but it's hard to say for sure. It's a personal connection that brings comfort and allows me to share life events with him."

##Q: What does achieving success in the UK mean to you?
"A: I never anticipated global success. Originally, my goal was to play small theaters in the UK. The UK has shown both pride and skepticism at different points in my career. I'm part of a lineage of UK artists, and I'm finding my place within that context."

##Q: How do you perceive the love and support from hip-hop artists?
"A: I appreciate it. In a way, it reminds me of how Phil Collins was embraced by hip-hop artists. I've felt both acceptance and exclusion within my genre. Hip-hop resonates with me more deeply than pop music, and that understanding comes through in my music."

##Q: What motivated you to get married when you did?
"A: I knew I wanted to marry her from the beginning. I bought the engagement ring six months into our relationship. For me, marriage signifies unity and commitment. It's about being a team and sharing a life together."

##Q: Has the recent tragedy at a festival changed your perspective on performing?
"A: That's a sensitive subject. I'd rather not comment on it. It's a heartbreaking tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families."

##Q: Does international success hold more significance for you than success in the UK?
"A: When I entered the US market, I was aware of UK artists who hadn't succeeded here. To set myself apart, I committed to hard work and building relationships. It's not about one place being more important; it's about connecting with fans and making meaningful music."

##Q: What did you do to overcome setbacks and pave your way to success?
"A: I did everything I could. I covered all the bases because I believed that if I left no stone unturned, nobody could say I didn't give it my all. Over time, things started falling into place. Success gained momentum."

##Q: What significance does breaking language barriers hold for you?
"A: Breaking into countries where they don't speak my language is something I take pride in. Selling out shows across Asia and Europe is a testament to connecting through emotions and feelings rather than just words."

##Q: Looking back at your debut single "A Team" after a decade, what advice would you offer your younger self?
"A: I'd say, 'Don't fear failure.' Failure teaches you far more than success ever will. Embrace your missteps and don't be embarrassed by them. People tend to remember your hits more than your misses."

##Q: Have you ever held grudges against those who treated you poorly early in your career?
"A: Initially, I did feel resentment, especially when my confidence was shaky. However, as my journey progressed, I realized that holding onto grudges doesn't benefit anyone. Confidence comes from within, and I've come to terms with those experiences."

##Q: Has anyone in the industry been notably unsupportive or negative towards you?
"A: I remember an incident involving a respected artist in the UK. He came up to me at an event after I won an award and told me he thought my music was terrible but that we could make something good together. It stung, especially since it was such a milestone for me."

##Q: Did you ever have conflicts with someone who has achieved more hits than you?
"A: At the time, he had more hits, but since then, I've achieved more success in terms of sales and concert tickets. It's not about holding onto grudges, but about appreciating success and recognizing the importance of kindness and support."

##Q: Your philanthropic efforts have included funding for your old school. Could you elaborate on that?
"A: I attended a state-funded school in the UK. When I learned that the arts were being underfunded, I decided to help. I contributed £10,000 each year to the drama, art, and music departments. This enabled the school to become a well-funded arts hub."

##Q: How does your foundation support the arts and mental health?
"A: Through my foundation, we provide music lessons and instruments to students in my county. Expressing oneself through art, music, and drama can positively impact mental health. I'm aiming to extend this support to other schools in the region as well."

##Q: What's your ultimate vision for your philanthropic endeavors?
"A: I plan to expand the reach of my foundation to more schools, eventually covering the entire East of England. My goal is to celebrate the arts and offer young individuals a chance to explore creative avenues as viable career options."

##Q: Have you considered moving to the US like many international artists do?
"A: The thought has crossed my mind, but many artists move to the US due to potential backlash in the UK. The American dream and acceptance of success are prevalent here, unlike in England where people might feel embarrassed about their achievements."

##Q: Are there any accomplishments you still aim to achieve?
"A: I'm not chasing records or trying to be the biggest anymore. I'm more interested in sustaining my career over time. Looking at artists like Coldplay, who remain relevant for years, I'd like to be part of the conversation even a decade from now."

##Q: Can you recall your first kiss and its significance?
"A: I remember it well. It was at a girl's house, and Elton John's 'Guess Why That's Called the Blues' was playing in the background. It was memorable, and I can vividly recall the moment."

##Q: Your song "First Times" speaks about various experiences. Are there still things you'd like to accomplish?
"A: Absolutely. While I've achieved a lot, the idea of having meaningful 'first times' in different aspects of life is always exciting. It's about staying open to new experiences."

##Q: Did you intentionally release your album before Adele's "30"?
"A: No, I wasn't aware of Adele's album release date when we announced ours. I learned about her plans later on. She's a massive artist, and while competition can be fun, I'm well aware of her stature."

##Q: Was your first sexual experience similar to your first kiss?
"A: Yes, I'd say so. Like the first kiss, it was a new and somewhat unfamiliar experience. There's always a learning curve with these things."

##Q: Could you clarify the inspiration behind "18" and its connection to a homeless prostitute?
"A: The song '18' was inspired by a girl named Angel whom I met while performing for a homeless charity. Her challenging life circumstances and experiences shaped the song's metaphors and themes. The song became a hit, but I didn't explicitly reveal its backstory at the time."

##Q: Have you ever tried to reconnect with Angel or do anything for her?
"A: Unfortunately, I couldn't get in touch with her after the song's release. It was a fleeting connection, but her story left a significant impact on me, shaping the essence of the song."

##Q: Have you ever thought about reaching out to the girl from the "18" inspiration for your song and reconnecting?
"A: I've tried to do things for the charity since then, and I have considered seeking her out. But I feel that if it were meant to happen, it would have by now. I've attempted to get in touch, but it's challenging when someone doesn't have a fixed address."

##Q: Are you still writing songs for other artists?
"A: Yes, absolutely. I find joy in writing for other artists. I've had recent successes like a Billboard number one with BTS, and I've also written for artists like Justin Bieber and Westlife."

##Q: What's the difference between writing for yourself and writing for other artists?
"A: When I write for myself, the songs are deeply personal and meaningful to me. With other artists, I get to experiment with different styles and genres, creating songs that might not necessarily fit my own brand but work perfectly for them."

##Q: How do you handle the expectations of your fans and the pressure to meet those expectations?
"A: My fans have a special connection with my early work, especially my first album. However, I can't let that dictate my creative choices. I've evolved as an artist and a person. While some may wish for me to recreate past albums, I need to stay true to my current self and continue to create meaningful music."

##Q: Have you ever recorded music that didn't fit your typical style and thought about releasing it?
"A: Yes, my album 'No.6 Collaborations Project' was a departure from my usual sound. It allowed me to explore different genres and collaborate with various artists. It was an opportunity to try things that I wouldn't usually do."

##Q: Do you ever feel pressured to meet certain standards or styles due to your fans' expectations?
"A: There's a pressure to please fans, but it's important to stay authentic. I've realized that chasing past successes doesn't lead to true fulfillment. I want to create music that reflects who I am now, regardless of how it's received."

##Q: What's the story behind your daughter's name, Antarctica?
"A: The name came about after my wife and I struggled with fertility issues. We were planning to see a doctor after a trip to Antarctica, and then my wife got pregnant. It felt like a miracle, and we wanted her name to symbolize that journey."

##Q: Do you find it challenging to balance your artist persona with your personal identity?
"A: Becoming a dad has given me a new perspective on my identity. I'm more than just Ed Sheeran the artist. I'm also Lyra's dad, and it's been a journey of self-discovery. It's important to embrace different roles in life."

##Q: Has the experience of fatherhood influenced your music and songwriting?
"A: Absolutely. Being a dad has shifted my perspective and allowed me to explore new themes in my music. It's a significant part of my identity now, and it's inevitable that it would influence my creative expression."

##Q: Are there any artists you'd love to write for in the future?
"A: Rihanna has fantastic taste in music, and I'd love to work with her. Her ability to make great songs without conforming to a specific style is inspiring. She's definitely a benchmark for me."

##Q: How do you handle situations where your songs aren't chosen by artists like Rihanna?
"A: It's part of the process. Not every song will resonate with every artist. I've submitted songs to artists like Beyoncé before that weren't chosen, but it's about finding the right fit. Sometimes, a song finds its home later on."

##Q: Do you believe in staying true to your artistic vision, regardless of commercial success?
"A: Absolutely. Staying authentic is crucial to me. It's better to have a body of work that I'm proud of, even if it doesn't top the charts. I've learned that creating music I believe in is more fulfilling in the long run."

##Q: What are your thoughts on your career trajectory moving forward?
"A: I'm hopeful for another 15 to 20 years of my career. I'd like to work with Rick Rubin again on a project. Originally, my second album was supposed to be an acoustic record, but it turned more pop with collaborations. I'd love to go back to the acoustic concept and work with Rick."

##Q: How do you feel about genre boundaries in today's music landscape?
"A: I think the concept of music genres has evolved, especially with today's generation. Genres are becoming less defined, and it's more about good music that resonates. Kids today have diverse playlists with artists from various genres, and it's refreshing to see music being appreciated purely for its quality."

##Q: How do you view the impact of music from different languages and cultures?
"A: I believe it's fantastic that music transcends language barriers. We're seeing genres like K-pop, J-pop, Mando pop, reggaeton, and afrobeat gaining global popularity. This wave of diverse music is breaking down boundaries and creating a worldwide stage for artists."

##Q: Do you think your collaboration with Justin Bieber on 'I Don't Care' could fit into one of your solo albums?
"A: I don't think the collaboration with Justin Bieber would fit into one of my solo albums. While it worked for our collaborative project, I believe we each have our unique styles. Our partnership created something special, but our individual careers have their own lanes."

##Q: Could you share your plans for future albums?
"A: I have an idea for my future albums. I have five more mathematical albums planned, and then five more symbol-based albums. In between those, I might explore different genres like folk or R&B. But these wouldn't be part of the 'blockbuster' albums; they'd be more experimental."

##Q: Would you consider releasing a final album after you're gone?
"A: I've thought about the concept of having a final album that's released posthumously. It's a slightly morbid idea, but it's intriguing to create a perfect album as a swan song and have it released on the day of my passing."

##Q: Do you believe talent shows like 'The Voice' can be challenging for young artists?
"A: I think talent shows have their pros and cons. While they provide exposure, they can also be challenging for young artists when they're voted off. I prefer mentoring roles where I can encourage participants to continue their musical journey beyond the show."

##Q: How did your father's confidence in you impact your career?
"A: My dad instilled confidence in me from a young age. He believed in my abilities and encouraged me to pursue my dreams. His support helped me navigate through disappointments and setbacks in the music industry."

##Q: Do you think the way talent show participants view their experience should change?
"A: Yes, I believe participants should view talent shows as a stepping stone rather than a destination. Even if they don't win, being on a show like 'The Voice' is a significant achievement that can lead to further opportunities in the music industry."

##Q: Would you ever consider being a judge on 'The Voice'?
"A: I don't think I'd be a judge on 'The Voice.' I find it challenging to send artists home, especially knowing the music industry can be filled with disappointments. I prefer mentoring roles to provide encouragement and guidance to emerging talents."
