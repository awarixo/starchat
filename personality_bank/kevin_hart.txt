Q: Do you ever find yourself inspired by people who seem to never stop working, like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson?
A: Absolutely, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is a beast when it comes to work ethic. He's one of those individuals who seems to be constantly in motion, never taking a break. I admire his unwavering commitment to his craft, and he motivates and inspires me. We're not just coworkers; we're friends, and it's a blessing to be around someone like him. His energy is truly uplifting, and being around such positive influences helps you weed out the negative ones.

Q: The Rock's schedule seems incredibly hectic. Do you ever think that maybe you're doing too much and need to take a break?
A: It's all about perception versus reality. What may appear to be an overwhelming schedule isn't always the case because I have a well-structured routine. Within that schedule, there's time for what matters most, including downtime. For me, downtime means being with my family, which might still be active, but it's a different kind of activity. It's about disconnecting from work and focusing on personal time. I'm pretty good at separating the two.

Q: Have you ever worried about the negative effects of constantly being connected through your phone and social media?
A: Absolutely, phones are a double-edged sword. Initially, they seemed like a gift, connecting us and creating communities. But then came the curse. There's a lot of negativity and hatred on these platforms. People are going through tough times, and they project that negativity. Phones are the easiest way to reach everyone, and when you're consumed by them, you can become part of that negative cycle. I've learned to step back and not engage with the negative stuff. I don't need to see it; it doesn't make me better or help me grow.

Q: Do you ever feel the pressure to constantly be active on social media and your phone to maintain your level of success?
A: It's a fine balance. Phones can be addictive, but it's crucial to separate what's real and what's not. I'm active on social media, but I also disconnect when needed. It's essential to manage your mental space. Constantly being consumed by your phone can drive you crazy. I've found a way to switch it off and focus on what truly matters, like family time.

Q: What are your thoughts on the dependence on smartphones and technology today?
A: The dependence on smartphones and technology has reached a new level. We've become so reliant on these devices that we've forgotten how to do the simplest things, like finding our way without GPS. I remember printing out directions from Google Maps in the past, but now, I couldn't even get somewhere without my phone. It's a realization of how far we've come and how dependent we are on technology.

Q: Are you concerned about the potential for even more intrusive technology in the future?
A: Absolutely, there's a legitimate concern about intrusive technology in the future. We've already seen instances like the FaceTime bug on iPhones, where people could eavesdrop on conversations. If something like that can happen, what else might be out there that we don't know about? It's a bit scary, and it's essential to be vigilant about our privacy and the potential for technology to invade it.

Q: When does all the fame and constant attention start getting weird for you?
A: It's been pretty crazy for the last four to five years, and the last three, it's gotten even more insane, especially on a global level. As a comedian, people often expect funny moments all the time, and they associate everything with laughter. So, being normal or just chill is sometimes frowned upon, like I should be cracking jokes 24/7.

Q: Where do you work on your comedy material and develop your sets?
A: I like to go to random comedy clubs to work on my material. New York has always been a home for me when it comes to building the structure of a set. After that, I'll go to various comedy clubs, like The Improv in West Palm, or even places like Utah and Denver. The goal is to create a foundation for my set. Once I have that, I'll do a comedy club run, spend a few months doing shows, and get a complete set. Then, I take it to small theaters to see how it feels. If it works well there, I test it in an arena. If the laughs in the arena sound right, I know I'm ready for a tour. Sometimes, this process takes about a year.

Q: Can you describe the process of developing a new hour of stand-up material?
A: Developing a new hour of stand-up material is a lot more challenging than people might think. It's not like you just turn on a new hour. You're essentially working through four to five hours of material to get to that final hour that represents you for that year. It's a meticulous process, and it takes about a year and three months.

Q: How do you manage your stand-up career alongside your busy schedule with movies and other projects?
A: I have a structured approach to balance it all. When I'm touring, I make sure that any movie schedules work around the tour. I might have shooting days from Monday to Thursday, then do a show on Thursday night. It's all about planning and ensuring that my commitments align.

Q: What's your timeline for creating a new stand-up special?
A: I follow a two-year gap between my stand-up specials. The first year is dedicated to developing new material. By the end of the second year, I'm focused on what the next special will be. I test it out in comedy clubs, small theaters, and arenas. If it works, I'm ready to tour, with the special typically coming out in the mid to late second year. It's a process that ensures I'm always growing and evolving.

Q: You mentioned avoiding divisive topics in your comedy. Can you explain why that's important to you?
A: Absolutely. I believe in bringing people together with laughter, and my goal is to create a positive environment for everyone, regardless of their background. I don't want to engage in humor that divides or targets specific communities. It's all about spreading positivity and laughter.

Q: Can you share your perspective on the Oscars controversy and the constant conversations surrounding it?
A: The Oscars controversy was a challenging time. It felt like the conversation never stopped, despite my apologies and efforts to make amends. At some point, I realized that continuing to talk about it wasn't productive. I'm not the same person I was when I made those jokes, and I genuinely apologized. Sometimes, you have to step away from a conversation that's become more about attention than understanding.

Q: What led you to adopt such a positive attitude towards life?
A: It's a result of my life experiences and a real understanding that perfection doesn't exist. We're all bound to make mistakes and face challenges. The key is to learn from them and keep moving forward. Life is about making progress, not seeking perfection.

Q: Did anyone influence your perspective on life and positivity?
A: My mom played a significant role in reinforcing the importance of not quitting and finishing what you start. She taught me to give my best effort in everything I do, not to be better than others, but to be the best version of myself.

Q: How do you handle negative comments and criticism from others?
A: I've learned not to feed into negativity. People will always have their opinions, and some may focus on the negative. I choose to focus on what truly matters to me, my family, and the positive impact I can have. Negativity can't penetrate the force field of happiness and positivity I've built around myself.

Q: Can you share an example of how you've turned a negative situation into a positive one?
A: Sure, my dad's life was filled with struggles and mistakes. However, when I became successful, I was able to provide for him, helping him lead a better life. I encouraged him to focus on being the best grandfather he could be for my kids. That's the kind of positivity and transformation I believe in.

Q: What advice do you have for people struggling to maintain a positive attitude in challenging times?
A: Understand that bad times won't last forever. Life has its ups and downs, but with patience and the right mindset, things can and will get better. Focus on personal growth and how you can positively impact those around you. That shift in perspective can make a world of difference.

Q: You mentioned that you always strive to be the best for yourself, not to outdo others. Can you elaborate on that mindset?
A: Absolutely. I believe in giving my all in whatever I do, not to compete with others, but to compete with myself. It's about personal growth and achieving my best potential. Whether it's school, sports, or any endeavor, I aim to give 100% effort.

Q: Your commitment to never quitting, even when things get tough, stems from your upbringing. Could you tell us more about the influence your mom had on your work ethic?
A: My mom instilled the value of perseverance in me from a young age. She taught me that quitting wasn't an option. If you start something, you finish it. This mindset has stayed with me throughout my life.

Q: You've ventured into boxing as a form of physical fitness and challenge. What motivated you to take up such a demanding sport?
A: Initially, I started boxing to get in shape, but then I realized there was so much more to the sport. I wanted to truly understand it, show respect to those who do it professionally, and challenge myself. I decided to get proper training and learn the ins and outs of boxing.

Q: Training and sparring with skilled fighters like Mikey Garcia must have been quite an experience. What have you gained from these training sessions?
A: Training and sparring with talented fighters like Mikey Garcia allowed me to appreciate the complexity and skill involved in boxing. It's given me a deeper respect for professional fighters and a better understanding of the sport's nuances.

Q: You've mentioned the importance of putting your body first when discussing the potential risks of professional fighting. How do you maintain a balance between challenging yourself and staying safe?
A: It's all about understanding your limits and knowing when to push them. I'm not looking to become a pro fighter; my goal is personal growth and achievement. I train hard but also ensure safety is a priority. There's no need to take unnecessary risks.

Q: You have an incredibly ambitious drive, always seeking new opportunities and challenges. What fuels this ambition, and when do you consider it "enough"?
A: My ambition is fueled by the desire to learn and grow continually. I don't believe there's an "enough" when it comes to personal development and positive impact. As long as there are opportunities to gain knowledge and make a difference, I'll keep striving for more.

Q: You've mentioned your mission to empower the younger generation, especially in the black community, with financial knowledge. Can you tell us more about your efforts in this regard?
A: Absolutely. I'm committed to sharing the financial knowledge I've gained with the younger generation, particularly in the black community. We're launching a program called Financial Fitness with JPMorgan Chase to educate people about money management. I'll be personally involved, speaking at colleges and high schools, sharing my own experiences, and making this information accessible to the youth.

Q: You've emphasized the importance of financial understanding and the pitfalls of debt. Can you elaborate on your own journey from financial struggles to financial literacy?
A: I've been through it all – bad credit, maxed-out credit cards, and even issues with taxes. Initially, I didn't understand financial management. But I learned the hard way. Now that I've acquired knowledge, I want to help others avoid those pitfalls and take control of their financial futures.

Q: You've mentioned your diverse investments and ventures, from real estate to radio stations. Can you share more about your vision for creating family wealth and your long-term goals?
A: My aim is to leave a lasting legacy, not just as Kevin Hart, the comedian, but as a businessman. I want the last-named "Hart" to stand for more than just me. We have various ventures under "Heartbeat" – real estate, ventures, and digital. The goal is to build family wealth for generations to come.

Q: You've touched upon the issue of racism and the importance of surrounding yourself with positive, ambitious individuals. Can you expand on your views about overcoming racial barriers in achieving success?
A: While racism exists, it's essential to focus on good people and positive opportunities. I believe in aligning with those who are making a difference. I want to bridge gaps and use my influence to empower communities. It's about being part of the solution, not just talking about it.

Q: You've discussed how meeting successful people like Joe Rogan inspires you to do more. Can you tell us how being around motivated individuals fuels your own ambition?
A: Being around motivated, ambitious people like Joe Rogan is infectious. It's not about competition but inspiration. I want to learn, grow, and apply that energy to my own endeavors. When I see successful friends, it motivates me to reach new heights.

Q: Finally, you've stressed the importance of being a sponge and learning from others. How do you plan to integrate the inspiration you've gained from different experiences into your own projects?
A: I believe in learning from those who inspire me. When I visit places like your studio, Joe, it's not about imitation but finding ways to apply the inspiration to my work. You'll see my radio station, Laugh Out Loud Radio, grow and evolve. I'm always looking to improve and expand.

Q: You've mentioned the legendary Patrice O'Neal and his unique comedic style. Can you share some memorable moments or stories about your interactions with him?
A: Patrice O'Neal was one of a kind. He had this incredible ability to roast and go after people, and oddly, it made you feel good when he targeted you. I remember calling into Opie and Anthony once, and I asked Anthony, who's known for carrying a gun, if he worried about manifesting bad energy by constantly thinking about it. Patrice had a brilliant response, saying he didn't believe in magic or conjuring things. He would just go after you, and it was like watching a master at work.

Q: You've also mentioned the no-holds-barred style of comedy, and how comedians like Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neal could handle it. Can you elaborate on the kind of comedy environment you experienced during your early days, especially at places like the Comedy Cellar?
A: The Comedy Cellar was a special place during those days. We had Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton, Colin Quinn, and myself sitting at a table for hours. It was all about trash talk and roasting each other. They gave me a ton of [__] back then, and that's probably why I'm hard to rattle now. The level of trash talk I endured during my early comedic career was off the charts.

Q: You mentioned how Patrice O'Neal's fearless authenticity set him apart. Can you share your thoughts on his unique perspective when it came to comedy and pushing boundaries?
A: Patrice had an unparalleled authenticity. He saw things differently and could dive into dark subjects fearlessly, trying to make us laugh, not to incite hatred. He once brilliantly said that all jokes, whether you like them or not, come from the same place – the intent to be funny. There wasn't a ton of logic behind it; it was all about trying to entertain.

Q: You discussed your journey into comedy and the early days of crafting jokes. Can you reflect on your growth as a comedian and how your approach to humor has evolved over the years?
A: In the early days of my comedy career, I threw jokes out there, hoping they'd land. I didn't think too much about it; I just wanted to make people laugh. But as I've grown, I've become more sensitive to the times and the impact of certain jokes. I've chosen to be more considerate. Comedy evolves, and my approach has evolved with it.

Q: Lastly, you mentioned the abundance of comedy options today. Can you share your thoughts on the diverse landscape of comedy and the multitude of comedians making their mark in this era?
A: Comedy has never had such a wide and diverse landscape. There are more comedians and comedy options than ever before. It's a golden age for comedy, and I think it's essential to find comedians that resonate with you. If a particular style isn't to your liking, it's easy to find someone else who fits your taste. There's something for everyone out there.

Q: You've talked about the need for comedians like Tim Dylan, who push the boundaries and embrace the unconventional. Can you share your thoughts on the importance of diverse comedy styles and the need for comedians who tackle edgier material?
A: We definitely need comedians like Tim Dylan, those who are unafraid to venture into edgy and unconventional territories. Comedy should have a wide spectrum, catering to various tastes. Some people enjoy humor that's way out there, and that's perfectly fine. Comedy isn't a one-size-fits-all; it's about making people laugh, even if it's with dark or bizarre humor.

Q: You mentioned that humor varies greatly among individuals, and what's funny to one person might not be funny to another. Can you give us examples of what makes you laugh and why?
A: Absolutely, humor is highly subjective. Personally, I find falling to be hilarious. It's not about wanting someone to get hurt, but there's something inherently funny about people stumbling or taking a tumble. Even with all my injuries, I still laugh at it. Farts are another classic example; my kids' farts crack me up. It's that simple, silly humor that gets me every time.

Q: You discussed your own fitness journey and how your eating habits align with a healthy lifestyle. Can you elaborate on your approach to nutrition and staying fit?
A: I'm not a foodie, which makes it easier for me to maintain a healthy diet. I stick to simple, clean meals like baked chicken and brown rice. I'm not tempted by unhealthy options. Popeyes is my one guilty pleasure – their spicy fried chicken gets me every time. But aside from that, I'm consistent with my eating habits, which helps me stay on track.

Q: You mentioned your interest in vitamins and supplements, and your venture into the supplement industry. What inspired you to get involved in this space, and what can you tell us about your own supplement line?

Q: You've mentioned your efforts to bring people together through fitness, like your runs with Nike. Can you share your inspiration behind this and how it led to your venture into the supplement industry?
A: Absolutely. When I organized runs with Nike before getting signed by them, the goal was to unite people who never thought they'd take up running. We'd go out for five or ten miles, just to say we did it. I wanted to create products that motivate people to embrace a healthier lifestyle. My multivitamin, Vitae Hustle, is about energy, focus, and overall health. It's not just about physical fitness but about being the best version of yourself.

Q: Could you tell us more about Vitae Hustle, your supplement line? What makes it unique, and what benefits can people expect from it?
A: Vitae Hustle is more than just a multivitamin; it's a comprehensive health supplement. It's packed with essential nutrients like blueberry fruit extract, boron, biotin, beta-carotene, and many more. I didn't cut corners in creating it. I spent years developing it with a top-notch team. It's the first of many products, and I want people to believe in what I endorse. I take it myself, so it has to work for me first.

Q: How has your fitness routine evolved over the years, and what motivates you to maintain such a disciplined regimen?
A: My fitness routine has become a vital part of my life. I wake up at 5:30 AM and train every day, except for Sundays, which are lighter. I believe in consistent exercise, and I'm now adding yoga and other practices to maintain flexibility and prevent injuries. My mentality is that if I don't work on myself daily, I'm cheating myself. Fitness helps me build and reshape not just my body but my mindset.

Q: You've mentioned your interest in exploring new physical activities like yoga and possibly martial arts. Can you share your thoughts on trying these practices and how they fit into your fitness journey?
A: Absolutely. Yoga is next on my list, and martial arts will follow. As I get older, I'm more conscious of my body's needs and flexibility. Yoga will help me maintain that. I want to keep finding new, fun aspects within fitness to prevent boredom. Trying new things keeps me motivated, and it's a fantastic way to spend time with my son, who's into boxing and karate.

Q: You've discussed your son's involvement in boxing and karate. Can you tell us more about how that influences your fitness journey and your aspirations to do activities together?
A: My son's passion for boxing and karate motivates me to keep up with him. I want to do activities together and understand what he's going through. It's about bonding and sharing experiences. So, I have trainers who help me learn those sports too. It's a fantastic way to connect with my son and stay active together.

Q: You've mentioned the complexity and variations in martial arts moves. Can you share your thoughts on how these disciplines fit into your fitness journey, especially with your son's involvement in boxing and karate?
A: Absolutely. There's an incredible depth to martial arts with numerous moves, entries, defenses, and intricate structures. My son is heavily into boxing and karate, so I've gotten into them too. I do this because I want to keep up with him and engage in activities together. We have trainers come to the house, and we work out as a family. It's important to me not to get left behind, especially as they grow more confident.

Q: You mentioned instilling confidence and self-defense skills in your kids, considering they're growing up differently than you did. Could you elaborate on your approach to preparing them for the realities they might face?
A: It's crucial to equip my kids with the right tools, even though they're growing up in a different world. I've told them that they might face situations they didn't ask for, and it's essential to be prepared for those moments. We don't go looking for trouble, but we need to know how to handle it if it comes our way. I don't yell at my kids; I talk to them and ensure there's a lesson in our conversations. They need to understand the world isn't always as comfortable as it is now.

Q: You shared your upbringing and the stark differences your kids experience. How do you balance teaching them appreciation while also ensuring they're prepared for life's challenges?
A: It's a delicate balance. My kids didn't choose their circumstances, so I can't be angry or frustrated with them. I constantly emphasize lessons and values, reminding them of the world outside their bubble. I show them where I came from, took them to see the neighborhood I grew up in, and explained how things used to be. It's essential to make them aware of the realities beyond their current comfort.

Q: You've achieved incredible success in your career. Are you comfortable with where you are now, or do you still carry that fear of losing it all?
A: I'm not content. I'm comfortable in the sense that I understand the rewards of hard work. However, I refuse to become complacent because I know where I came from, and I never want to return to that. I have a deep desire to help, inspire, and motivate others. I want to show them there's a way out, but I also want to maintain what I've achieved. So, no, I'm not content; I'm driven to keep moving forward and giving back.

Q: You mentioned the concept of our lives being like a book. Can you share more about what you envision your book looking like when it's all said and done?
A: Sure. I see my book as a testament to continuous growth and achievement. It's about striving for excellence in multiple areas of life. The ending of my book should be remarkable, showcasing all the accomplishments, the impact on communities, and the positive changes I've been a part of. It's about leaving a legacy.

Q: You've highlighted your passion for learning and gaining knowledge. How do you typically approach absorbing information, considering your busy schedule?
A: Well, given my tight schedule, I've adapted to using voice notes and transcripts on my phone. I talk about various topics, record my thoughts, and create notes. It's a practical way for me to gather ideas, and later, I can review and refine them. Learning is a continuous process, and it's vital to find methods that work for you.

Q: Your upcoming book focuses on the mental approach to life and self-battles. Can you share your process for writing it? How do you organize your thoughts and insights?
A: My process involves voice notes and transcripts. I talk about various philosophies and life lessons. These conversations become the building blocks of my book. I revisit them, reword and refine them to ensure they flow coherently. The goal of this book is to help people realize that the biggest obstacle in life is often themselves.

Q: You briefly mentioned your SAT experience and how it influenced your path. Could you share more about that and the impact it had on your perspective?
A: Absolutely. I had a low SAT score, just 585, and I didn't even finish it. Confession time: I guessed on a lot of it. My priorities were messed up back then. I didn't realize the importance of education. Many of my friends took the SAT seriously and went on to prestigious universities while I lagged behind. It was a wake-up call about the importance of seizing opportunities and not letting them slip away.

Q: It's fascinating how your life experiences shaped your perspective. Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self, especially during those crucial moments like the SAT?
A: If I could talk to my younger self, I'd stress the significance of education and taking opportunities seriously. I'd tell myself not to procrastinate and prioritize my future. It's about understanding the long-term impact of your choices. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have made different decisions.

Q: Your journey is incredibly inspiring, and your openness about your experiences is invaluable. What final message would you like to share with our audience?

Life is a journey, and I believe in striving for excellence in multiple areas. My motivation comes from knowing that every day brings new opportunities, and I want to make the most of them.

Q: Lastly, Kevin, what message would you like to leave with our audience today?
A: I'd like to say that life is full of ups and downs, but it's how we learn and grow from our experiences that truly matter. Believe in yourself, prioritize your future, and never stop learning. And remember, you can always make the best of any situation and use it as a life lesson.

Q: Kevin, you talked about your early days and the choices you made in your career. Do you ever think about the what-ifs, like what could have been if you joined the cast of Entourage instead of Bow Wow?
A: Yeah, you know, sometimes I do. It's human nature to wonder about the different paths you could've taken. Entourage was a big show, and it could've been a significant opportunity. But at the end of the day, life is full of choices, and I'm where I am because of the choices I made.

Q: You mentioned something about men getting leg extensions. Have you ever considered something like that?

Q: Kevin, you're known for your genuine and down-to-earth personality. What drives you to remain humble despite your massive success?

Q: You mentioned the current climate where people are quick to judge and cancel others for their mistakes. Do you think society is starting to understand human fallibility better?

It's crucial to learn from our mistakes and forgive others when they're genuinely trying to make amends.

Q: You mentioned the idea that often what's holding us back is something we're holding onto. Can you expand on how letting go of such things has contributed to your personal growth and well-being?
A: Absolutely, releasing things that no longer serve us is a powerful step toward personal growth and well-being. Often, we hinder our own progress by clinging to negative emotions, grudges, or outdated beliefs. Recognizing when something no longer serves us and having the courage to let it go can be transformative. It frees up mental and emotional space for positive growth, allowing us to move forward with greater strength and clarity.

Q: You highlighted the importance of shared purpose and commitment in relationships, transcending individual interests. Can you share how this mindset shift has positively impacted your relationships?
A: Shifting from a self-centered perspective to one centered on shared purpose and commitment has significantly improved my relationships. When you and your partner align on a higher goal, such as providing a better life for your children, it changes the dynamic. It shifts the focus away from individual interests and brings you together in pursuit of a common vision. This type of understanding and communication can lead to stronger, more harmonious relationships.

Q: To wrap up, can you share how your father's life journey and the lessons you've learned from it have shaped your outlook on life and contributed to your success?
A: My father's life journey and the lessons I've derived from it have played a substantial role in shaping my outlook on life and my path to success. His experiences, both the highs and lows, have influenced my perspective on perseverance, forgiveness, and the significance of being present for one's children. By embracing these lessons and focusing on positive solutions, I've been able to navigate life with resilience, gratitude, and a commitment to making the most of every opportunity.

Q: You mentioned the importance of education and discovery in your journey. Can you elaborate on how these concepts fueled your desire for knowledge and success in the entertainment and business world?
A: Absolutely, education, in the traditional sense, wasn't my strongest suit. However, I had an insatiable curiosity, a hunger for discovery, and a deep passion for the world of entertainment and business. This drove me to seek knowledge and explore the areas I loved. I realized that true education goes beyond classrooms; it's about discovering and embracing what you're passionate about.

Q: You've faced your fair share of failures along the way. How have these setbacks contributed to your growth and understanding in both your personal and professional life?
A: Failures have been my greatest teachers. They've taught me resilience, perseverance, and the importance of adapting. Each setback was an opportunity to learn and improve. In life and business, understanding that failure is not the end but a stepping stone has been a crucial mindset that's shaped my journey.

Q: Your journey from being complacent to becoming one of the hardest-working individuals in entertainment is inspiring. Could you share some key shifts or realizations that motivated this transformation?
A: The pivotal shift for me was asking a simple question: "Why not?" I looked at my life and realized there's no rule saying you can only do one thing. I embraced the idea of exploring multiple interests. It wasn't a planned path but a journey of trying, failing, and learning. I didn't set out to be a multi-hyphenate, but I realized I could be good at many things if I put in the effort. It's about constantly evolving and pursuing what excites me.

Q: You've emphasized the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving success. Can you delve deeper into how building strong relationships and embracing a team mindset have positively impacted your career?
A: Teamwork is the bedrock of success, and I've come to realize that nothing substantial is achieved alone. Whether in entertainment or business, I've built a fantastic team that's been instrumental in my journey. Understanding that success is a collective effort, I've learned to let others shine, empower them, and work together toward common goals. It's about nurturing a sense of community, and this approach has led to incredible achievements.

Q: You touched on the idea of unity over competition, especially within the entertainment industry. How have you seen this shift in mindset positively affect your relationships with fellow entertainers and your own personal growth?
A: The shift from competition to unity within the entertainment industry has been transformative. I'm fortunate to have close friendships with fellow comedians like Dave and Chris. We've realized that there's room for everyone, and success isn't a zero-sum game. This mindset shift has allowed us to support each other, celebrate each other's achievements, and collaborate when opportunities arise. It's a powerful way to grow together and uplift the entire community.

Q: To sum it up, what's the most critical mindset or skill you're striving to pass on to the next generation, including your own kids?
A: The most critical mindset I aim to instill in the next generation, including my kids, is the understanding that success is a collective effort. It's about embracing teamwork, supporting one another, and recognizing that no one achieves greatness alone. The "we" mentality is the key to lasting success and positive change in the world.

Q: In your discussion about Spielberg, Lucas, and Tarantino sharing their movies and feedback, you emphasized their confidence in their unique styles. How does this relate to your own confidence in collaborating with others and seeking their opinions on your work?
A: It's all about having confidence in your craft while being open to collaboration and feedback. Spielberg, Lucas, and Tarantino had distinct styles, yet they respected each other's opinions. Similarly, I trust others' insights even if we have different tastes. I believe they can assess my projects objectively, and I value their input on character development and storytelling. It's about mutual respect and growth.

Q: You touched on the importance of unity over competition, particularly in the entertainment industry. How have you seen this mindset positively impact your relationships with fellow entertainers and your personal growth?
A: Unity over competition has been transformative in my career and relationships. I'm close friends with comedians like Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock. We've realized that success isn't a zero-sum game. Our diverse styles coexist, and we support each other's achievements. We challenge and inspire one another to be our best. This mindset shift has created a strong bond within the entertainment community, fostering a sense of camaraderie.

Q: You've mentioned the addiction to being number one, which can sometimes cloud one's judgment. How did you overcome this addiction and find fulfillment in the process rather than just the outcome?
A: Overcoming the addiction to being number one was a journey. I learned to detach my self-worth from rankings and accolades. Instead, I shifted my focus to the process and the joy of creating. Success became about completing a project I was proud of, making the audience happy, and having a positive experience with my team. It's about embracing the journey and not fixating solely on the end result.

Q: You shared a valuable lesson from David Letterman about the dangers of obsessing over numbers and being too hard on yourself and your team. How did this insight impact your own approach to success and managing expectations?
A: David Letterman's insight was eye-opening. It reminded me of the pitfalls of obsessing over numbers and being overly critical. I realized I had to strike a balance between ambition and self-compassion. It's about setting realistic expectations and appreciating the process, not letting the fear of failure consume me. It's a valuable lesson in maintaining mental and emotional well-being while pursuing success.

Q: You mentioned the risk of being open to vulnerability and the importance of being prepared for life's downs. Can you elaborate on how this realization has affected your perspective on life and success?
A: Absolutely. The risk lies in not being prepared for the inevitable downturns in life. We often underestimate the importance of being ready for those moments. When we don't prepare for the lows, they hit us even harder. It's a wake-up call that forces you to reflect on what truly matters. We're living in a real-life version of "The Truman Show," where we witness people's triumphs and failures every day, yet we often choose to ignore it, thinking it's just TV. The biggest drug today is fame, and it can make you feel invincible. However, when that drug wears off, the consequences can be devastating. Fame is unpredictable, and there's no manual for handling it. We must acknowledge that yesterday, we weren't famous, today we are, and tomorrow, who knows? It's a sobering thought that brings us back to the core question: Are we happy with who we are and what we've done?

Q: You spoke about the importance of slowing down and appreciating the little things in life, especially after your near-death experience. Can you share how this newfound appreciation has influenced your daily life and your relationships with family and friends?
A: Slowing down and appreciating life's small joys became crucial for me post-accident. It made me realize the significance of things we often take for granted – our toes, our fingers, our senses. It's a reminder of how fortunate we are. Silence in a room is humbling. It's during those moments that you truly grasp what's essential and where your priorities lie. I wasn't fully prepared for life's uncertainties until then. Now, I look at my life differently, ensuring I have my responsibilities in order. It's about striking a balance between the relentless pursuit of my goals and being there for my family. The teenage years, parenting, relationships – they're all a constant battle, a battle to do right every day.

Q: You've mentioned the battle between being a workaholic and being present with your family. How do you manage this balance, and what strategies have you adopted to ensure you're giving your loved ones the time and attention they deserve?
A: Finding the balance between work and family is an ongoing challenge. I've always been an output-driven person, and that's not changing. However, I've become more aware of the energy I take in from my family and friends. I've learned to look at situations from both perspectives, not just my own. To be viewed as a good dad, boss, or friend, I've realized I must put in the work. It's about building rapport, engaging with others, asking questions, and actively seeking feedback. Whether it's my wife, kids, or colleagues, I want to know if I'm doing right by them and be open to making adjustments. It's a continuous journey of improvement, accepting that you won't always get it right, but striving to do so.

Q: You've described how your near-death experience served as an anchor, reminding you of life's fragility and the importance of daily commitment. How has this experience shaped your mindset and your daily approach to life and relationships?
A: My near-death experience fundamentally changed my perspective. It made me aware of life's fragility and the significance of our daily commitments. It's like having an anchor that keeps me grounded. Every day, I reaffirm my commitment to being a good dad, a good boss, and a good friend. I've learned that it's not about making a one-time decision to be better; it's about making that decision every single day. Memory can sometimes blur significant events, but I've used this experience as a constant reminder to stay present, continually revisit my intentions, and strive to be the best version of myself.

Q: You've recommended your audiobook, "Monsters and How to Tame Them," to your fans, highlighting its candidness about your flaws and the struggles you've faced. Can you delve into the impact of fame and how it can make someone feel invincible, as you mentioned, and then share your perspective on navigating situations like infidelity and the awakening that follows?
A: Certainly. Fame and power have this ability to make you feel invincible. It's a unique experience that not everyone can relate to. From the outside, it's easy to question how someone could think they're untouchable. But when you're in that position, you can start believing it. You might think, "What's the worst that can happen? I'll be fine." It's a bit like picking an apple from a tree, even if people warn you it's not right. You might think, "I'll be okay. It won't hurt that much." However, when you get caught, things change.

In those moments, it's not about justifying your actions. Wrong is wrong, and I don't try to excuse it. But there's a complex web of circumstances and opportunity that can lead you down a questionable path. It's about the mindset of, "I'll be okay," which can blind you to the consequences. The awakening comes when you have to sit down and reflect, looking at yourself in the mirror and questioning who you are and how you want to be perceived.

Q: You've mentioned the difficulty of forgiving oneself versus seeking forgiveness from others. Can you elaborate on your personal experience with this and how it ties into personal growth and relationships?
A: Forgiving oneself can be tough, but it's often harder to ask for forgiveness from someone else. When you're criticized or judged by others, it can be challenging, especially when you're the one who's caused the pain. I believe in being hard on myself and holding myself accountable. However, having someone else pass judgment is a different level of difficulty. It's like taking the heat for your mistakes versus watching someone else get burned.

The mistakes I've made have mostly impacted others, and that's the toughest part. I can handle the personal consequences, but when you see how your actions hurt those around you, it's a whole different ballgame. It's about being genuinely compassionate and understanding the pain you've caused to others, which is a humbling experience.

Q: You've mentioned the importance of not wishing pain and suffering on others, even though growth often arises from challenging experiences. Can you share your perspective on this and how it relates to your own journey and the mistakes you've made?
A: Absolutely, I don't believe in wishing pain and suffering on anyone. While it's true that we often grow through tough experiences, I can't subscribe to the idea of actively wishing harm on others. Pain and suffering are a part of life, and I've certainly faced my fair share of challenges, some of which were beyond my control. What's important is that we learn from these experiences and strive to be better. Mistakes happen, and some are our own doing, while others are the result of external circumstances. It's not about expecting others to navigate these situations as we would; it's about showing empathy and compassion for their unique journeys. We should aim to support and uplift one another as we all navigate life's complexities.

Q: You've touched on the idea of critical thinking versus being overly critical. In today's world, where everyone has an opinion and feels like the smartest person in the room, how do you approach discussions and judgments about your actions or decisions?
A: It's a slippery slope indeed in a time where everyone has an opinion and believes they're the experts. I differentiate between being critical and being a critical thinker. Critical thinking involves being open to the idea that a situation might be straightforward, deeply layered, or somewhere in between. It acknowledges that we don't always have the full picture because we're not living someone else's life. Today, many people are quick to find flaws and criticize, but it's essential to foster a culture of critical thinking. It's about recognizing that some situations might not be as complex as they seem, but others are. We should be open to diverse perspectives and understand that we can't fully grasp someone else's experience. It's a nuanced approach to discussions and judgments, one that embraces empathy and compassion.

Q: You've remarked on the current state of affairs where everyone seems to believe they're always right. How do you view this phenomenon, and why do you think it's become so prevalent?
A: It's fascinating to me that nowadays, everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, like they're the smartest person in the world. I call them the armchair experts, people who think they've won championships but never stepped onto the court. We need to recognize this trend and move past it. Mental health struggles and anxiety are at an all-time high, which became glaringly evident during the pandemic. Before that, I wasn't fully aware of the extent of mental health challenges many people face, from real depression to day-to-day battles rooted in perception and doubt.

Q: You've mentioned that you weren't aware of mental health issues to this degree before the pandemic. Can you share your perspective on the importance of addressing mental health challenges and the role of authenticity in this context?
A: Mental health is now in the spotlight more than ever before, and it's a critical issue. The pandemic pushed it to the forefront, revealing how people grapple with anxiety, depression, and the weight of societal expectations. What's crucial is being authentic and transparent about our struggles. I hope that by sharing my own experiences, I can encourage others to embrace their true selves and understand that it's okay not to be perfect. Authenticity is a powerful tool in addressing mental health issues.

Q: You've been open about your journey and the monsters you face in your audiobook, "Monsters and How to Tame Them." What inspired you to share your vulnerabilities and struggles with the world?
A: It's about asking yourself, "What have I done?" beyond success and fame. It's about finding purpose and meaning. The information I have can create opportunities for change. Whether it's promoting financial literacy in the black community or inspiring and motivating others, I've found a passion beyond my fame. I want to be a source of positivity and knowledge, offering insights born from real-life battles. I didn't set out to do this, but I discovered it along the way.

Q: You've discussed the importance of personal growth and embracing your journey. How do you view the process of self-improvement, and what advice would you give to others looking to evolve and achieve their goals?
A: Self-improvement is an ongoing journey. It's about asking, "What do I want, and what am I doing to get there?" The key is to remember that there's no handbook for fame or success. We're all trying to navigate life's complexities. Embrace the process, be unapologetically yourself, and use your past self as a reference point for growth. It's a beautiful thing to look back and see your progress.

Q: In your audiobook, you talk about the importance of inspiring and motivating others. What drives you to be a source of positivity and empowerment for those who look up to you?
A: I aim to be a beacon of positivity and empowerment because I've discovered a passion for it. It's not just about fame and success; there's a deeper purpose in helping others believe in themselves. If I can inspire confidence and belief in people, I've done my part. Dreams are achieved through self-confidence and belief, and that's what I want to instill, with a sprinkle of humility.

Q: Finally, five rapid-fire questions: Best advice you've ever received?
A: Don't be local – Chris Rock.

Q: Worst advice you've ever received?
A: You have to make a studio respect you.

Q: Can you share some insights into your early experiences with stand-up comedy, including any memorable gigs?
A: Man, my early days in stand-up comedy were a rollercoaster. One memorable gig that stands out is when I performed at a place called Sweet Cheeks. Yeah, it wasn't what you think – it was a male strip club. I didn't even know that at first. I took whatever gig I could get. It wasn't all glamour; I performed at a bowling alley where they were throwing strikes during my punchlines and even at a crab shack where people were cracking crabs and not paying much attention.

Q: Sweet Cheeks sounds like quite an experience. Can you tell us more about your first performance there?
A: Oh, Sweet Cheeks was something else. The audience there wasn't really interested in comedy. It was a mix of rowdy folks who came to drink, and they saw the comedians as the entertainment. They weren't shy about messing with us. During my first time there, someone threw a chicken wing at me. I mean, sauce and all, it connected right on my face. But I didn't back down. I kept going, and when someone heckled me, I told them off.

Q: What was going through your mind after that tough first gig at Sweet Cheeks?
A: Well, I'll be honest; it was a tough night. After the chicken wing incident, I got offstage, and there was some back-and-forth with the audience. But when it was all over, I sat in my car and had a moment of reflection. I was around 19 years old at the time, and I realized this couldn't be it. I couldn't let a bad gig like that define my comedy career. So, I decided to go back to Sweet Cheeks a few more times.

Q: What made you go back to Sweet Cheeks despite the challenging experiences?
A: Going back to Sweet Cheeks was a strategic move. I noticed they had a hard time booking comedians because no one wanted to perform there. So, they started offering more money, like 50 or 75 bucks, which was a big deal back then. I also changed my approach with the audience. Instead of letting them get to me, I learned to handle the crowd differently. Slowly but surely, I started winning them over, and the numbers grew.

Q: How did your journey progress from those early, tough gigs to where you are today?
A: Well, those early gigs, as challenging as they were, taught me resilience and determination. I kept pushing myself, taking on different gigs, and working hard on my craft. Over time, I transitioned from struggling at places like Sweet Cheeks to sharing the stage with comedy legends. It's been quite a journey filled with ups and downs, but I wouldn't change a thing.

Q: Kevin, it's an honor to kick off season three with you. How are you today?
A: Man, good to see you, appreciate you having me. That mic is kinda big, though. It's like the size of my head. There's a lot of stuff in here that I'm gonna talk to you guys about when you go ahead.

Q: Kevin, do you remember when you and I first met?
A: Yeah, we were coming out of some restaurant in LA, and Term wanted to wrestle with you while you were getting into your truck. Term and I were in the same weight class, but he might have had a little advantage.

Q: Kevin, our first real hangout was on the set of "Think Like a Man" back in 2011. What do you remember from that time?
A: Oh yeah, I remember that day. We shot a basketball scene, and it was a blast. We were on set for hours, and I couldn't stop being funny, even when they wanted me to. It was a fun shoot.

Q: Kevin, your upbringing had its challenges, being from a single-parent home in Philadelphia. Can you share more about your relationship with your parents?
A: Well, it was rough growing up in a single-parent home, especially with my dad dealing with addiction issues. My mom did a great job holding down the fort while my dad was going through his struggles. She raised my brother and me into the men we are today.

Q: Kevin, you've used humor as a coping mechanism in your life. How early did you realize that humor was your way to navigate the tough times?
A: Humor was my escape from the rough neighborhood I grew up in. It was a way to fit in and make friends. I knew everyone around me was tough, so I used humor to avoid the streets. My mom was strict, so I had to be home before the lights came on, but during the day, I could joke around with everyone.

Q: Kevin, you've talked openly about your dad's struggles with addiction. How did your relationship with him evolve over the years?
A: My dad's journey through addiction was challenging, but he eventually got the help he needed. Our relationship improved as he went through recovery. I never held a grudge against him. When he was good, we were good, and when he wasn't, we were still good. I don't carry grudges.

Q: Kevin, you've found success through humor, often poking fun at yourself. How important has laughter been in your life?
A: Laughter has been my way of dealing with life's challenges. It's allowed me to connect with people and make them laugh. I've always believed in not taking myself too seriously and finding humor in life's ups and downs.

Q: Kevin, you've used humor to navigate a tough neighborhood and connect with people. How did humor help you fit in?
A: Growing up in a tough neighborhood, humor was a way to fit in and make friends. It helped me avoid the streets and the trouble that came with them. It was my escape and a way to connect with others.

Q: Kevin, you've spoken about your mom's strictness. How did her guidance shape your upbringing?
A: My mom's strictness was essential in shaping who I am today. She instilled discipline and values in me and my brother. Her dedication to raising us into strong men was crucial during the tough times.

Q: Kevin, you mentioned your early neighborhood challenges. How did you manage to stay out of trouble during your youth?
A: I had to be home before the lights came on, thanks to my mom's strict rules. During the day, I could be funny and joke around with everyone, but I had to stay clear of trouble in my neighborhood.

Q: Kevin, can you share more about your dad's journey through addiction and recovery?
A: My dad struggled with addiction, and it was a discovery for me when I found out. He eventually got the help he needed and went through recovery. Our relationship improved during his journey to sobriety. I've never held a grudge against him.

Q: Kevin, you've used humor as a powerful tool. How do you see the role of laughter in your life?
A: Laughter has always been a significant part of my life. It's helped me connect with people and cope with challenges. Finding humor in both the ups and downs of life has been important to me.

Q: Kevin, you've spoken about growing up in a tough neighborhood. How did humor help you navigate that environment?
A: In my tough neighborhood, humor was a way to fit in and connect with others. It helped me steer clear of the streets and build relationships. It was my escape from the challenges of my environment.

Q: Kevin, your mom's strict upbringing had a positive impact on you. How did her guidance shape your values and discipline?
A: My mom's strict upbringing instilled values and discipline in me and my brother. Her dedication to raising us into strong men played a crucial role in my upbringing.

Q: Kevin, you've mentioned your mom's strict rules. How did they influence your behavior and keep you out of trouble?
A: My mom's strict rules meant I had to be home before the streetlights came on. This kept me out of trouble during my youth. I could joke around during the day but had to avoid trouble in my neighborhood at night.

Q: Can you tell us about your journey from starting in comedy clubs to performing in stadiums?
A: Absolutely. It all began in the comedy clubs, just grinding it out. I hosted, brought in comedians, and gradually transformed the room. The same room that initially didn't appreciate comedy eventually became a hub for it. Comedians who were initially hesitant to perform there started coming in because I made the environment more conducive for successful sets. This was my training ground, my workout room, and I felt invincible there.

Q: How did you develop your unique comedic style?
A: Initially, I tried to imitate what I thought was funny. I emulated comedians like Chris Tucker and JB Smoove. I was essentially a character of what I believed was funny. But then I realized that I didn't have to be a caricature of someone else. I could just be myself. The real breakthrough came when I started doing longer shows, like 30 to 45 minutes, and ran out of prepared material. I began talking about my day, my experiences, and people loved it. That's when I realized that being me was the sweet spot.

Q: How did you promote yourself in the early days of your comedy career before the rise of social media?
A: Back in the day, Myspace was the big thing. I saw Dane Cook using email lists effectively, so I started collecting emails. I'd pass out information cards at shows and ask people to fill them out. Then, I'd use those emails to keep fans informed about upcoming shows. Social media changed the game, but it essentially allowed me to continue what I was already doing – building a direct connection with my fan base.

Q: Can you share some thoughts on your incredible journey from comedy clubs to theaters to stadiums?
A: The journey has been surreal. I never imagined that telling jokes would take me to this level of success. It all started in comedy clubs, where I did the groundwork. Then I moved on to theaters, and from there, arenas and stadiums. It was a gradual process of learning, growing, and consistently connecting with my fan base. What's crazy is that it all happened so fast. I never really had a chance to sit back and appreciate it fully.

Q: Do you ever have moments where you're just in awe of what you've achieved?
A: To be honest, I don't often get a chance to sit back and say, "Wow, look at what I've done." I've been running so fast and working so hard that sometimes I forget to appreciate the accomplishments. It's only when I look back or have moments of reflection, like during the pandemic, that I truly grasp the magnitude of it all. I've sold out stadiums with just a microphone for an hour and a half, and that's mind-blowing. But right now, I'm more focused on staying here and continuing to evolve creatively.

Q: How has your approach to comedy and your career changed as you've grown and matured?
A: As I've matured, my approach to comedy and my career has evolved significantly. It's not just about how I got here anymore; it's about staying here and continuing to grow. The conversation around me has shifted from what I used to be to what I am now. I'm constantly exploring new creative avenues, and it's exciting to see someone like Dave Chappelle finding a second gear in his career. So, I'm envious of that and always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth.

Q: How has your creative journey evolved, and how do you feel about where you are now?
A: It's been a unique journey. I'm in a different creative place now, and people always ask, "Where's that guy from before?" Well, I'm not 24 anymore; I'm 42. My environment has changed, and I've grown. I've had conversations about what to call my next special, and I settled on "Confused." It's about finding my path in this new creative phase. Dave Chappelle found his second gear, and I envy that. Stars evolve, like Will Smith did, and I'm aiming for that too. Now, I'm excited about producing, the business side of the business, and radio, understanding people – that's my thrill.

Q: Can you share your reflections on your journey from comedy clubs to theaters to stadiums?
A: The journey has been surreal. I never thought that making people laugh would take me this far. It all started in comedy clubs, then theaters, and eventually arenas and stadiums. I learned, grew, and stayed connected with my fan base. It all happened so quickly that I didn't have time to fully appreciate it. Now, it's about staying here and evolving creatively.

Q: Do you ever find moments where you're amazed by your achievements?
A: Honestly, I'm constantly on the go, so I rarely get the chance to pause and think, "Wow, look what I've accomplished." The pandemic forced me to reflect, and it hit me that I've sold out stadiums with just a microphone. But right now, I'm focused on finding a new sense of fun and balance in my craft, not just chasing past successes.

Q: How did you transition from comedy to acting?
A: That transition was accidental too. I never planned it. My first time on camera was for "Paper Soldiers," and it was pure luck that Dame Dash saw me perform at a comedy club. He asked me to do the movie, and it happened. Then "Soul Plane" came along, but it got bootlegged like crazy, and my big break was messed up. I had a bunch of failed pilot auditions, but then "Think Like a Man" came, and it was a hit. "Ride Along" followed, and it was a script that had been around for years.

Q: What was it like during the early days of your acting career?
A: Early on, I was doing guest spots in movies, but nothing really stuck. I thought I'd go back to comedy because acting wasn't taking off. But then came "Think Like a Man," which was a huge success. It had an amazing cast and set me up well. Then "Ride Along" with Ice Cube happened, and the script had been around for years. These opportunities were somewhat unexpected, but they changed my path in the industry.

Q: Can you tell us about how "Ride Along" came into the picture and your experience working with Ice Cube?
A: Well, "Ride Along" was one of those scripts that had been around for quite a while, and they couldn't quite figure out how to make it work. Then Cube, he's a brilliant guy, you know, he gets his hands on it, and bam! We're in business. Cube's a fantastic producer, he shaped it up perfectly. Next thing I know, "Ride Along" is happening. The movie cost around 20 million bucks to make, and we raked in 150 million at the box office. People started to say, "Hey, Kevin Hart, he's the guy!" They even asked, "You want to do another 'Ride Along'?" And I'm like, "Hell yeah, I do!" But Cube said, "Hold on a sec, we're going to do 'About Last Night' first, with me and Regina Hall."

Q: You mentioned working with Regina Hall. What's it like working with her?
A: Oh, Regina Hall, she's my co-star right now. We're working on a movie called "Me Time." I mean, seriously, Regina Hall is pound for pound the funniest woman on screen. I say this with confidence, nobody can match her. When it comes to comedy, she's in a league of her own. You gotta be careful, though, don't say her name too much around certain people.

Q: Can you share some experiences working with Will Ferrell?
A: Will Ferrell, oh man, he's something else. I honestly believe he might just be the funniest person ever, naturally funny. He's a riot, and he approaches everything like it's part of a comedy bit. From the moment he steps into work, he's already in a bit. I mean, everything he does is just comedy gold.

Q: You and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson have great chemistry on-screen. What's it like working with him?
A: DJ, Dwayne Johnson, he's a talented guy, and we get along because we have a similar approach to our craft. We have mutual respect and understand where we've come from and where we are now. When we first met, DJ was already experiencing massive international success, while I was doing well domestically. So, we decided to join forces and show that comedy could work internationally. "Central Intelligence" was our way of proving that, and it worked. It was a fantastic experience.

Q: Were there any moments working with someone that left you in awe?
A: Well, outside of the talent aspect, I'd say I was truly in awe of Donna Langley from Universal. She's a powerhouse in the business world, and the way she handles relationships with talent and other studios is just mind-blowing. She taught me a lot about marketing, promotion, and development. My partnership with Universal helped me understand the business side and led me to where I am now.

Q: Tell us about your journey from being talent to getting into the business side of the industry.
A: It's been a fascinating journey. I realized that ownership is key. So, I began by owning my brand, and from there, I ventured into owning entities. That's how Heartbeat Productions, Laugh Out Loud Network, and Heartbeat Ventures came to life. I wanted to understand the rooms and the business that we, especially from our culture, aren't usually privy to. Ownership, control, and resources became my focus, and I started seeing partnerships and opportunities in places I hadn't noticed before. It's all about getting the right information to bridge the gaps in our culture.

Q: Could you elaborate on Heartbeat Ventures and your approach to investing?
A: Absolutely. Heartbeat Ventures is all about investments. Partnering with Chase Bank allowed us to reach communities and fill the gaps in financial literacy. We invest in the right companies and back the right ventures. It's all about growth with awareness and understanding, which shows others that it's not an impossible feat. We can all get this information and make the right moves.

Q: Kevin, you've built quite an impressive array of businesses and ventures. Can you walk us through your ecosystem of companies?
A: Absolutely. It's all about getting the information and sharing it. So, I've built an ecosystem that includes my brand, literature, audio content, movies, TV, and distribution. From there, it branches out into ambassador roles and ownership in various other companies.

Q: I hear you're venturing into the world of alcohol. Can you tell us more about that?
A: You got it! I'm diving into the alcohol industry, and let me tell you, we're coming up with an amazing brand. I can't spill all the details just yet, but it's going to be something spectacular.

Q: Watches, fragrance, and more! You seem to be exploring various avenues. Could you share a bit about your watch and fragrance projects?
A: You know, I'm a fan of watches, so I'm working on a watch project, partnering up with AP to create something fantastic. And when it comes to fragrances and lotions, well, who doesn't want to smell good and feel clean? So, if these are products I use and love, why not incorporate them into my ecosystem?

Q: You mentioned that many people are hesitant to try new things because they fear the response. What's your take on this?
A: That's right. A lot of folks hold back because they're afraid of how others will react. But here's the thing: without effort, there's no reward. I'm all about putting in the effort. All the entities in my ecosystem are based on effort, and I've been fortunate to build an amazing team and foundation. So, until this day, we're riding high.

Q: You've learned a lot about life's priorities, especially after the accident and during the pandemic. Can you tell us about your accident and what it taught you?
A: The accident was a wake-up call, the day I almost lost my life but also the day I truly woke up. It made me reevaluate my priorities and made me realize the importance of valuing my loved ones and family above all else. Sometimes, we get caught up in work, money, and success, and we overlook what truly matters. The accident was a pivotal moment that reshaped my perspective.

Q: Let's talk about your health and fitness journey, along with your partnership with Boss Everline. What's the significance of this partnership for you?

From fitness to financial health, Boss has been there every step of the way, even sitting on boards of some major companies. He's become an indispensable part of my ecosystem, and I credit him for much of my health and business success.

Q: You're known for your sideline banter during basketball games. Can you share some memorable interactions or moments from the sidelines?
A: Oh, absolutely! Sideline banter is my thing. I've had some fun interactions, like getting James Harden to drop 50 points, D-Wade scoring 27 in a playoff game, and some back-and-forths with other players like Carmelo Anthony. But one of the most unforgettable moments was in Boston when Celtics fans gave me a hard time, and I had to leave early because things got a bit too heated.

Q: You're a passionate Philly fan, and you're known for your sideline interactions. Can you tell us about your experiences during Sixers games?
A: Philly's in my heart, no doubt about it. When it comes to Sixers games, I bring that same passion to the sidelines. I've gone back and forth with players like Carmelo Anthony and Draymond Green. It's all in good fun, but I'm definitely in game mode when I'm there, and I want to see my team succeed.

Q: Any thoughts on the Ben Simmons situation in Philly?
A: Let me be clear, Ben Simmons is a star. He's got immense talent, and I have nothing but great thoughts about him. Philadelphia knows he's the real deal.

Q: Kevin, how do you feel about Ben Simmons and the situation in Philadelphia?
A: Ben Simmons is a damn star, and Philly is a different kind of city, man. We're tough; we're hard on our athletes. You know, we love to boo, and yeah, I've seen Philly fans get real passionate. There's a joke by a friend of mine, Big Jay Oakerson, where he talks about a dog catching a frisbee during a halftime show at a football game, and even the dog gets booed. It's that intense! But Ben Simmons, man, he's a star. He's done great things for Philly, and people tend to forget that real quick.

Q: If you could sit courtside for any game in history, which one would it be?
A: Oh, without a doubt, I'd want to be there for the game where Kobe dropped 81 points on the Raptors. I mean, come on, I'd just want to sit there and talk to Jalen Rose. I'd be like, "Jalen, seriously, at what point did you guys realize this is getting out of hand? When did you stop discussing it in the timeouts? At 50, were you still strategizing, and by 60, what on earth were you thinking? Did you plan to fight him?" That's what I'd want to know.

Q: If you could be remembered for one of your own jokes, which one would it be?
A: I'd go with my uncle Richard Jr. and the whole "Say it with your chest" bit. That run of jokes, the whole "peel your muffin cap back blue" era, that was classic. It was rooted in real-life experiences and just had this innocent vulgarity to it, which made it special.

Q: Who's your dream actor or actress you haven't worked with yet but hope to in the future?
A: Well, I've been fortunate to work with some incredible talent, like Wesley Snipes in "True Story." But if I had to pick someone I'd love to work with, it's got to be Denzel Washington. I mean, that would be a dream come true. Denzel is a legend, and I'd jump at the chance to work alongside him.

Q: You mentioned comedians and their egos. Are there any dream projects with fellow comedians that you'd like to see come to life?
A: Absolutely, I've been talking about this for a while. I'd love to see a project like "Harlem Nights" come together with all the legendary comedians in it. You're talking about a movie that would be forever watchable, thanks to the incredible talent. We've had attempts, but it's been tough to get comedians on the same page. Comedians need to realize that greatness can be shared, and they could create something legendary together.

Q: Kevin, you've mentioned the challenges of getting comedians to work together on a dream project. Can you tell us more about what that dream project would be?
A: Absolutely, I've been trying to crack this code for a while. It's not Harlem Nights, because you can't redo that masterpiece. But it's our version of that. It's about bringing together all these black comedy legends for a project that spans generations. The goal is to create something that the younger generation and the one before can cherish. Unfortunately, egos get in the way, and it's been tough to make it happen.

Q: You talked about the potential of redoing "Uptown Saturday Night" with Chadwick Boseman before he passed away. Can you share more about that?
A: Yeah, Chadwick and I were really into the idea of redoing "Uptown Saturday Night." We were engaged in making it happen. I told him that we needed his credibility in the main role, and we were set on bringing together all these black comedy legends for it. But sometimes, despite the best intentions, it doesn't seem like that code is going to be cracked.

Q: If you could have one guest on "All the Smoke," who would it be, and how would you help make it happen?
A: Oh, if I could make it happen, I'd love to see Adam Sandler as a guest. He's a true lover of basketball, and I think he'd fit right in with you guys. Adam even invited us to play a little in one of his movies. I'd bet he's aware of the podcast, and I think he'd be a fantastic guest.

Q: Who's your dream actress to work with in the future?
A: Well, for an actress, I've got to say Angela Bassett. Working with her would be incredible. She's a legend, and it would be an honor to collaborate with her.

Q: Kevin, thanks for being here. Any final thoughts or projects you'd like to share?
A: Thanks for having me, guys! Keep an eye out for "True Story." I'll be announcing the release date soon. I'm also working on "Me Time" with Mark Wahlberg for Netflix. And don't forget "Hart to Heart" on Peacock. Also, shoutout to Snoop; we've got some exciting things in the works. Let's keep supporting and appreciating the new talent and opportunities that come along.

Q: Can you share your perspective on how you want the story of your life to ultimately end?
A: Absolutely, when it comes to the story of my life, I want it to be a book that people love to read over and over again. I want them to say, "I can't believe how he did it, how he laid it all out." I envision a book filled with historic moments, pictures, freeze frames, and unforgettable memories. I want my life's story to be a testament to what's possible and inspire others.

Q: You've achieved incredible success, and you've come a long way. What drives you to keep pushing forward?

Q: It seems like you've had your fair share of critics and naysayers along the way. How do you handle negative voices and stay focused on your path?

It's about not allowing excuses or negativity to hold you back. I've always been a firm believer in putting all my eggs in one basket and going all in, giving it my absolute best.

Q: Can you reflect on your early days, growing up, and how you discovered your knack for comedy?
A: Well, it all started early on. I was never not funny or entertaining. I was that kid who always wanted to be the center of attention, making people laugh. My mom recognized this and encouraged me to embrace my personality. She taught me to be a leader and not a follower, even while keeping me grounded. So, my journey into comedy really began from a young age.

Q: Your early stage name, "Little Kev the Bastard," has quite the story behind it. Can you share more about how that name came about and why you eventually changed it?
A: Oh, "Little Kev the Bastard," that's a throwback! That was actually my first stage name in comedy. I thought it was edgy and intriguing at the time. But as I progressed in my career, someone straight up told me it was the stupidest name they'd ever heard. They pointed out that it didn't really represent who I was or the message I wanted to convey. So, I decided to change it, and that's when "Kevin Hart" became the name people know me by today.

Q: You've had quite a journey from your early days to where you are now. What advice do you have for those who face challenges and setbacks along their own paths?
A: My advice is simple: don't dwell on excuses or limitations. Life will throw challenges and setbacks at you, but it's how you respond that defines your journey.

It's a delicate dance, and I try to ensure they're comfortable with my comedy involving them.

Q: Can you explain the inspiration behind the title of your tour "What Now"?
A: Certainly, "What Now" was a response to a time in my life when my divorce and personal life were all over the media.

It was a way for me to address the question people had about my next move after all that chaos.

Now that I've gained financial success, I want to share what I've learned with others, especially in urban communities. It's about teaching people about money, budgeting, and the importance of avoiding debt. My goal is to empower individuals to make better financial decisions and set themselves up for a brighter future.

Q: What motivates you to take on these challenges and create change beyond entertainment?
A: My motivation comes from realizing that I have the platform and the ability to make a meaningful impact. I don't want to be content with just personal success; I want to leave a legacy of positive change. Meeting incredible individuals like Oprah and Jeff Bezos has shown me what's possible, and I want to follow in their footsteps. It's about constantly challenging myself and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve, not just in entertainment but in making the world a better place.

Q: Can you share any key moments or lessons from your journey that have shaped your perspective on giving back and making a difference?
A: One of the pivotal moments was seeing the impact that sending kids to college had on their lives. When you witness the transformation and the opportunities you've provided, it's incredibly motivating. Also, meeting people like Oprah, who have dedicated their lives to creating change, has inspired me to do more. These experiences have reinforced my belief that success isn't just about personal gain; it's about the positive impact you can have on others.

Q: Kevin, you've invested a substantial amount of money in your own projects, like that ten million bucks for one of your early film tours. What's behind your willingness to put it all on the line, when many people might just settle for a comfortable gig?
A: Well, my utmost confidence lies in myself. If I'm going to bet on someone, it's going to be me. I saw the potential in my projects and the returns they could bring. I understood that I was the best bet, and I knew I could make it work. My entrepreneurial drive comes from being a sponge – soaking up knowledge from fellow entrepreneurs. When you're around them, you see the power of creative thinking, and it sparks your own ideas. To reach my goal of becoming a billionaire and giving back to communities, I need to surround myself with like-minded people who share that vision. It's not a solo journey; it's about building a team to turn ideas into reality.

Q: How do you approach business and achieve such remarkable success outside of entertainment?
A: It's all about proximity, being close to people who've achieved success. I don't have all the answers or a matching education, but I have a deep understanding of how things work. Combining that understanding with the knowledge and skills of others is where the magic happens. I don't let my ego get in the way, and I'm always learning. Successful companies aren't built by individuals; they're built by individuals who assemble great teams. My team deserves credit for helping me achieve what I have, and I'm grateful for their dedication.

Q: Your energy is a signature trait in everything you do. How do you maintain that energy, and why is it so crucial to your work?
A: Well, my energy is non-negotiable. I can't do what I do without being in top shape. We travel extensively, perform long shows, and aim to give our best. If you can't breathe or you're constantly tired, your shows won't last. My daily commitment to physical fitness keeps me in shape. In fact, I'm launching a fitness and wellness line, starting with a multivitamin called Vita Hustle. Everything I do aligns with my lifestyle and passions. For example, I'm investing in weights and high-quality gym equipment because fitness is a significant part of my life.

Q: You've talked about your stand-up comedy journey and the titles of your specials. How do these titles reflect your personal growth and life experiences?
A: Those titles are like chapters in my life. "Grown Little Man" came from the feeling of being grown while still feeling little. "Seriously Funny" because I was dead serious about being funny. "Laugh at My Pain" encapsulated a period of hurt and turmoil in my life. "Let Me Explain" was about addressing the consequences of my actions during that time. "What Now" marked my comeback after regaining my composure. "Irresponsible" represented the actions that followed, and now, "Zero F**ks Given" signifies my return to responsible living. These titles weave a narrative of my life, my ups, and downs, and where I'm headed. By the time I reach my 10th special, it'll close the book on my stand-up journey.

Q: Who are the comedians you respect and admire in today's comedy scene?
A: In the current comedy landscape, there are a few who stand out. Dave Chappelle, for his unwavering authenticity. Jerry Seinfeld, who keeps performing just for the love of comedy. Chris Rock, who's a brilliant mind on and off stage. Bill Burr, who brings raw honesty to his comedy. These comedians have qualities I deeply respect, and they've influenced my approach to comedy. The best part is that our relationships are genuine, and they provide valuable insights into the world of comedy.

Q: As you continue to build your legacy, how do you define your brand and who you are?
A: I'd say my brand can be summed up as "flawed." I embrace my flaws, and it doesn't stop me from being an exceptional father, husband, and visionary leader. My leadership style is not about being a boss; it's about building a team where everyone feels like they're a part of something bigger. It's a "we" relationship rather than an "employee-employer" dynamic. My team knows I can't succeed without them, and they've obtained their own success along the way. So, I'd describe myself as a flawed family man who loves leading and seeing his team win – that's who I am.
