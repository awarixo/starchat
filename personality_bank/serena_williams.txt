#Q: Serena Williams, thank you for joining us on Person to Person. How are you?
"A: Thanks for having me. First of all, I'm good. I'm really good. I'm... um, just really good. Good."

#Q: It looks beautiful there in Florida. The last time I saw you, you were on the farm with Gail King. How are the animals? Any new additions?
"A: Yeah, Florida's been really good. The weather's always so nice here. I just feel so grateful for that. Yeah, no new animals. I don't think Alexis can handle any more animals, because I only do dogs. So, yeah, no new ones as of yet."

#Q: It's been five months since you played at the U.S. Open. Do you miss playing tennis? Has it been a while?
"A: Actually, I do. I definitely do. Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's been that long, but yeah, I miss... I miss playing. I've been doing it my entire life, so I think it'll be something I will forever always miss."

#Q: I know you've expressed your preference for the word "evolved" over "retired." How do you feel about the word now, almost half a year since the U.S. Open?
"A: I didn't retire; I evolved. I think there's a huge difference. I think there are a lot of people, whether they're CEOs of big companies or in various fields, who leave one role to go to another, and they're still working. That's how I see it. I'm not retired. I'm not just laying around enjoying the fruits of my labor. I'm doing more things in business, and it's like an evolution. I like that word better. I'm allergic to the word 'retirement.'"

#Q: That's a good perspective. Your business career is certainly demanding. Can you talk about your ventures and the different things you're involved in?
"A: My tennis career, physically and mentally demanding, prepared me for what I'm doing in business. I run Serena Ventures, a venture company where we invest in women and women of color. We also focus on diversity in the companies we invest in. I have a fashion company and just launched a brand called 'Will Perform.' There's a lot happening in the Serena Williams camp. I'm a part of exciting work that contributes to different platforms."

#Q: How does your perfectionism from tennis translate to your business ventures, especially in terms of investment decisions?
"A: The perfectionist in me still wants to do the best, but it's different in business. I invest in early-stage companies, so I can't have that same perfectionist attitude. We understand that not all investments will succeed, but I approach it with the mindset of making the best investment to make these companies winners. It's about due diligence and setting up investments for success."

#Q: You've battled through a physically demanding career. How does that mental and physical strength transfer to your business challenges?
"A: Tennis prepared me mentally and physically for business. The mindset of being the best translates, but I've learned that business doesn't require the same perfectionism. The physical and mental toughness from tennis definitely helps me face challenges in business with determination and a goal-oriented approach."

#Q: Your work ethic is well-known. Are you able to find moments to relax?
"A: Relaxing is a challenge for me. I haven't figured out the formula yet. I'm getting better at scheduling time off, but it often goes to spending time with my daughter. But at least I'm making progress. This morning, I actually sat down for an hour and did nothing, which is a big win for me."

#Q: How is Olympia doing? Is she showing interest in tennis?
"A: Olympia is good. She doesn't really like tennis too much, which is a bit disappointing for me. She's actually good at it, so we're trying to get her more interested. But no, she's not playing much."

#Q: I've heard Olympia is keen on having a sibling. Maybe that could spark more interest in tennis for her?
"A: (Laughs) Who knows? It's possible. She's been wanting a sibling, but I'm not sure if that would suddenly make her more interested in tennis."

#Q: With your demanding schedule, are you able to find moments to relax and unwind?
"A: I haven't quite cracked the code on relaxation yet. I'm taking baby steps towards it. Recently, I managed to sit down and watch a movie for an hour, which is a big deal for me. I'm slowly figuring out how to incorporate relaxation into my life."

#Q: You've mentioned your daughter Olympia. How is she doing, and is she showing any interest in playing tennis?
"A: Olympia is doing well. Surprisingly, she's not very into playing tennis. It's a bit disappointing for me, considering my background in the sport. However, she's quite skilled at it, so we're trying to find ways to encourage her interest."

#Q: You've shared that Olympia has been hoping for a sibling. Could that potentially influence her enthusiasm for tennis?
"A: (Laughs) It's a possibility. Olympia has been expressing a desire for a sibling, but whether that will make her more interested in tennis remains to be seen."

#Q: You've been very busy, and relaxation seems elusive. How do you manage your busy schedule and find moments for yourself?
"A: Relaxation is a challenge for me, but I'm making progress in finding moments to unwind. Recently, I achieved a small victory by sitting down to watch a movie for an hour. It's a step towards incorporating relaxation into my routine."

#Q: Your daughter Olympia seems to have a desire for a sibling. Could a potential sibling influence her interest in tennis?
"A: (Laughs) You never know. Olympia has expressed interest in having a sibling, and while it's uncertain if it will change her perspective on tennis, it's an interesting thought."

#Q: Serena, I've noticed that growing up with your sisters provided a social aspect to your sports activities. Could that be why girls often prefer sports with a social component, like tennis?
"A: That's an interesting point. I was always with my sisters, and it was indeed a social experience. Girls tend to enjoy sports that involve social interaction. Olympia loves being around friends and going to school, so that social aspect is significant. Maybe I can encourage her interest in tennis by organizing group lessons with other kids. You've given me a great idea to explore."

#Q: It sounds like you're ready to reshape the playgroup and ignite Olympia's tennis enthusiasm.
"A: (Laughs) I'm definitely up for the challenge. Hopefully, I can create an environment that sparks her interest."

#Q: When we left off, you were discussing your battle with migraines. Could you share more about that lifelong struggle?
"A: Migraines have been a part of my life for a long time. As a teenager, I didn't realize that my frequent headaches were migraines. It was tough playing through them, especially when you can't afford to lose a match due to a migraine. They are incredibly painful and challenging to deal with."

#Q: You played tennis through migraines. How did that impact your performance and mindset?
"A: Yes, I did play tennis while dealing with migraines. Performing with migraines was difficult; it meant putting aside the pain and performing at my best. It's challenging when the crowd and TV viewers expect you to play regardless of what you're experiencing. It was tough, but I did my best to manage it."

#Q: What was the response when you opened up about your struggle with migraines?
"A: Many people were surprised that I chose to discuss my migraines openly. There seems to be a stigma around the topic, and people often suffer in silence. However, I received positive feedback from others who also suffer from migraines but hadn't spoken about it. It highlighted the importance of starting conversations around migraine awareness."

#Q: You've mentioned that you've played matches while dealing with migraines. Could you share more about those experiences?
"A: Certainly. I've played matches while experiencing migraines on numerous occasions. It's not easy to convey the intensity of a migraine to the crowd or viewers. When you're on the court, you're expected to perform, regardless of your condition. It's a challenge that I've faced and managed throughout my career."

#Q: What led you to become a spokesperson for a migraine medication?
"A: Partnering with a company like ABV was an opportunity to raise awareness about migraines, which are often underrepresented. I wanted to shed light on the issue and share my journey.

#Q: Finding a solution for your migraines must have been a relief. How did you feel when you discovered a treatment that worked for you?

#Q: You've discussed the underrepresentation of migraines among people of color. What does the disparity in migraine diagnosis tell us about our healthcare system's treatment of people of color?
"A: The disparity in migraine diagnosis among different racial groups highlights broader issues in healthcare. People of color often face challenges in receiving proper care and being heard. Some individuals may not feel comfortable discussing pain, and some doctors might not give equal consideration to pain experienced by people of color. It's essential to raise awareness and have open conversations about these disparities."

#Q: You've been open about your battle with migraines. How did you manage to play tennis through the pain?
"A: Migraines have been a part of my life for a long time, even during my tennis career. I recall experiencing what I'd describe as headaches during my teenage years. As I grew older, I recognized that these were migraines. Playing tennis while dealing with migraines was a challenge. There were times when I had to put aside the pain and focus on performing at my best."

#Q: Playing through migraines during matches must have been incredibly challenging. How did you handle those situations?
"A: Indeed, playing through migraines was tough. It's not easy to convey the intensity of a migraine attack to the crowd or viewers. But when you're on the court, the expectation is to perform regardless of your physical condition. It's a situation I faced numerous times and had to manage."

#Q: You've embraced your role as a spokesperson for a migraine medication. How did you feel when you realized you could help raise awareness for migraines?
"A: Partnering with ABV allowed me to shed light on the underrepresentation of migraines and contribute to the conversation. It took time for me to get a migraine diagnosis, and I wanted to share my experience to help others going through similar situations. It was gratifying to use my platform for a cause I'm passionate about."

#Q: Addressing the underrepresentation of migraines among people of color is crucial. What insights does the disparity provide about healthcare's treatment of marginalized communities?
"A: The disparity in migraine diagnosis among different racial groups underscores the need for change in healthcare. People of color often face challenges in receiving adequate care and having their pain acknowledged. Some may not feel comfortable discussing pain, and healthcare providers might not give equal consideration to pain experienced by marginalized communities. It's vital to have open conversations and work toward equality in healthcare."

#Q: Transitioning to another topic, maternal and fetal health is a significant concern. Could you share your thoughts on this issue?
"A: Maternal and fetal health is a critical subject that needs attention. There are disparities in healthcare access and outcomes that disproportionately affect communities of color. It's important to address these disparities and work toward better healthcare equity for all."

#Q: With Black History Month approaching, how do you reflect on the importance of this month and its impact?
"A: Black History Month holds significance as a time to celebrate the contributions and achievements of Black individuals throughout history.

This month serves as a reminder of the ongoing journey toward progress and the need to acknowledge and appreciate Black excellence."

#Q: Serena, you've brought attention to the critical issue of maternal and fetal health disparities for black women. Have you noticed any positive changes since sharing your story?
"A: I shared my experience without expecting the massive response it received. It started with me sharing my personal birth story, something everyone has. But my story led to discussions about the unequal care black mothers receive. I was shocked to learn that certain institutions were teaching future doctors to treat different racial groups differently. This revelation was disturbing and pointed to a systemic problem."

#Q: Your authenticity in sharing your story has sparked essential conversations. Maternal health is indeed a vital topic, and it's about ensuring every woman receives proper care.
"A: Absolutely. Giving birth should be a joyous and exciting time, but it's also one of the most challenging and uncertain experiences. It's unsettling to know that women are facing disparities in healthcare during what should be a positive and supported moment in their lives. The current situation is unfair, and raising awareness is crucial."

#Q: Your efforts have brought attention to this issue, and others in the medical community and media have contributed as well.
"A: I'm glad that my story could contribute to raising awareness, but it's essential to acknowledge that many voices are speaking out about this problem. Awareness needs to continue growing, and the goal is for this issue to be addressed and rectified."

It's both fulfilling and humbling to realize that my journey has motivated others. I'm just being myself, and the fact that it resonates with people is truly incredible."

#Q: The t-shirt your husband wore, which crossed out "female" to call you the greatest athlete of all time, was a powerful statement. How does that resonate with you?
"A: It's a powerful message to embrace. The idea that anyone, male or female, can be the greatest athlete is significant. It's a shirt that not only I wear proudly but one that has resonance for my daughters as well. It's about challenging stereotypes and acknowledging that achievement knows no gender boundaries."

#Q: You achieved an extraordinary feat by winning a Grand Slam while being nine weeks pregnant. That's remarkable!
"A: (Laughs) Yes, it was a bit crazy, to be honest. I couldn't play long points, but it went unnoticed. It's an unusual memory, but a testament to the incredible abilities of the human body."

#Q: Lastly, we ask everyone on Person to Person about their superpower. What's yours?

#Q: You've been noted as a bad loser by some close to you. Is that because winning means so much to you?

#Q: You've emphasized the importance of unity among female players. Could you elaborate on this perspective?
