# Man, you're gorgeous. 
Awww.

# That smile speaks a universal human language. Do you ever think about how huge you are right now? 
I just came back from the gym, and I'm driving down Sunset and I see a massive billboard that says San Andreas, and I'm like, "Wow, that's great! This worked out!" I get corny like this. And I swear to God, I turn my head and there's an even bigger billboard that says Ballers. Man, I can't believe it.

# What a path. You look like an old wrestler I used to see every once in a while.
I've been fortunate to have had the life I had prior to Hollywood. I wasn't starving, I was going to eat the next day. I came to Hollywood wanting a career that had longevity, and I wasn't afraid to take risks because I had a dollar in the bank. I wasn't driven by money as much as I was driven by making a successful transition. And I was smart enough to know that I certainly didn't have all the answers and I needed to surround myself with smart people and be willing to take risks and be willing to fail.

# Whaddya got?
Potatoes and chicken. A postworkout meal. 

# How are the potatoes prepared? 
They're cut like french fries, but they're baked. Phenomenal. And the chicken is just a grilled chicken with a little bit of some sort of barbecue sauce.

# You want ten minutes to eat? I don't want the food to get cold. 
No, it's fine. I'm rarely sitting and eating, so this is nice. 

# As long as you're comfortable.
It's funny, journalists will come in and say, "Thank you so much for sitting with me; I know your day's been so long." I've got to be honest with you, we're literally sitting here talking. It's the easiest thing. Everything's free, we're at this hotel, you've got free food, we're just talking about things. 

# I was talking to Mickey Rourke a long time ago, after he quit acting for boxing. He felt that acting wasn't manly. I've talked to other actors who seemed tortured by the work for other reasons. You're having nothing but fun. 
I think wrestling for $40 a night and eating at the Waffle House three times a day, wrestling every weekend at a flea market, then at a state fair or a car dealership or in barns, "blade jobs," where I cut my forehead with razor blades... These days I never question, "Oh, do I deserve it? Am I a real man?" No.

# How accurate is The Wrestler? All that stuff's for real? 
It's very accurate. I would do blade jobs. I get a call once from the WWE, saying, "Vince [McMahon] would like to see you in Stamford." I went to his office and he says, "I really think you have a lot of potential, but you're not ready for the WWE. You should go to Memphis, Tennessee. That's where I want you to learn the business." And as I was leaving, he said, "You keep working hard, but don't go down there and cut your fucking forehead with razor blades, you understand me?" In the '60s and '70s and early '80s, the trainers would grind you and eventually they would break something�they would break an ankle in ways that it would heal. It was just the way of the business, to ensure that you learned respect for wrestling. It was crazy. My dad [Rocky Johnson, a WWE Hall of Fame grappler] didn't break anything on me, but he grinded me out every day for months. 

# Do you enjoy making movies as much as you enjoyed wrestling?
In the '60s and '70s and early '80s, the trainers would grind you and eventually they would break something�they would break an ankle in ways that it would heal. It was just the way of the business, to ensure that you learned respect for wrestling. It was crazy. My dad [Rocky Johnson, a WWE Hall of Fame grappler] didn't break anything on me, but he grinded me out every day for months. 

# Did you feel self-doubt as you were building your career as an actor?
When I first came into acting, I had great opportunities to make a decent movie. I had a run there in 2005, '06, '07�for a long time it was "Oh, he's the best thing in the movie that's not that good." I started questioning: Did I make the right choice? Should I have stayed in wrestling a bit longer? And then budgets became lower and lower and the pay kinda stayed the same and there wasn't a lot of growth. 

# You also got smaller. Literally.
The big stars didn't look like me�and I didn't look like them. There wasn't a blueprint or a model. Well, here's a former football player who once wrestled and he's this height and this weight. He's black and Samoan and he has tattoos... And then it was slim down, stop working out as much, get distance from wrestling and the moniker of the Rock. There were a lot of changes�the people around me at that time felt like it was the best thing to do, but by the way, I bought into it. I embraced it. Well, like anything, when you start being someone else, not being yourself, you may get lucky and it may work for a little while, but it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass eventually. So there was a big moment of clarity in about 2010�I just felt, Yeah, this isn't working. I need to stop, readjust, reassess, and change everything around me�and I gotta take one more shot, but at least
 I'm gonna take a shot with me being myself.

# What do you weigh these days? 
Two-forty, 250, 260, depending on the role. I think for San Andreas I was 240. But I think what's interesting is when you finally make that decision and clarity becomes king in your life, the weight doesn't become an issue. Like, who gives a fuck how much you weigh?! Just go out there and put on a great performance. 

# That must be liberating. Working out has to have been a way of life for you. 
At a very young age, at five, I was with my dad down in the wrestling ring and in the weight room, watching all these guys wrestle, jack iron all day. It was a different world. Everything was dirty: dirty gym, dirty mats. My dad said, "I'm getting up at six; you're gonna get up at six, too. I'm having my coffee; you have your orange juice. I'm going to the gym; you come to the gym with me." And then on the mats, I would roll around and these guys would throw me around and wrestle around with me. It was always "What you want?" You gotta get up in the morning, you gotta get after it, you gotta
 put in the work, you gotta sweat. There's gonna be heavy iron and there's gonna be a lot of sweat, and it's gonna be dirty. 

# Have you ever gone wrong trusting your gut, trusting your instincts? 
I've never gone wrong trusting my gut. It was really the only thing that I had going into acting. I didn't have the background�Juilliard or performing-arts school or anything like that. You can get great people around you, smart minds and great resources, but it's still from here [points to heart]. Steven Spielberg has this great quote: "Moviemaking is always about noise. There's so many voices that you've gotta listen to. But you've always got to pay attention to the one voice that's in your gut that always tells you it's still not good enough." 

# That voice can do a lot of damage. 
There was a time in my life when opportunities were so few and far between they were like little cracks in the wall, and if one opportunity came my way, I would scratch and claw and bite and I would do anything I could to make sure that I grabbed that opportunity by the throat and I did not let it go. They're a bit more frequent these days, I have more coming my way, but I still look at it like it's a crack, and I attack it. I'm a long way away from ever getting evicted again, but man, I think about that so much. That's where my "we've got to make sure this happens" and "let's go" type of energy comes from.

# I wonder if fatherhood makes that feeling even more pronounced. 
Absolutely. I feel that way for my little girl. I never want her to experience that at all. 

# Were you taken seriously when you started transitioning into being an actor? Did people think of you as a lunkhead? 
When I sit in these big meetings with the head of marketing, head of distribution, looking at the big boards to figure out how we're gonna deliver the movie and where we're gonna go, where we're strong, where we need to see some uptick�there's not much of an issue that can come across my desk where I really go, "Wow, I don't know how to handle that!" It's like, I've been through all this
 other shit before. I never quite understood why if you're successful in something, and then you want to make the transition to Hollywood, why wouldn't you apply the same discipline and processes
 that you did with wrestling and football? Which meant: surround myself with great acting coaches; definitely get a good director; I need great actors around me to help me raise my game; I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I need great acting coaches, I need good directors, I need help. I have been told I have potential. I think I do. Let's give it a go. And that allows more people to say, "Okay, let's give it a shot." Compared to: I think I'm gonna be great. I'm gonna make 30, 40 movies. 

# Nobody who's ever referred to themselves as humble seems humble to me. 
Good point. 

# Am I gonna like Ballers [currently on HBO]?
You'll get a kick out of it. The guy, Spencer Strasmore, is everything I dreamed of being. I dreamed of being an NFL player, All-Pro, making money, buying my parents a house, the whole thing, like he has done. 

# That's delicious.
That is who I failed at being! That's the irony of it. 

# The name of your production company is Seven Bucks Production because you literally had seven bucks to your name? Those stories always seem apocryphal. Did you really have only seven bucks?
I did. In 1995, I called my old man when I landed in Miami [after getting cut from the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders] and I said, "Dad, you gotta come get me." I didn't have a car at that time. He drove in his little truck from Tampa to Miami, picked me up, and we were on our way up I-75, the famous Alligator Alley, and I thought, Shit, how much money do I even have? Pulled out my wallet, and yeah, I had a five, a one, and some change. I remember thinking, Fuck, all I have is seven bucks. At that time I wanted so much more. Warren Sapp had just signed for millions of dollars in the draft. He was the one that actually beat me out of my position [at Miami] two and a half years earlier. Not to begrudge him at all; we're still good buddies today and I'm very happy for him. But it was like the success I wanted so badly and worked so hard for for years was happening all around me to everyone else but me. And I'll never forget that. The term "seven bucks" has a lot of meaning.

# I just watched a YouTube video of you singing to [former WWE manager] Vickie Guerrero [in the ring]... You have a very delicate voice for a man who presents physically the way you do.
Thank you. In Polynesian culture, the men run 300, 350 pounds and the women are even bigger. But Polynesian men are known for singing in a pitch that is soft falsetto singing. It sounds amazing. That's just how they sing, at a very high pitch in an octave that's very falsetto and soft. I fool them with my voice. I'm singing in Disney's next animated musical, called Moana. 

# Has there been any single special moment when you knew you'd made it as an actor? 
About three weeks ago, I'm here at the house and I get a letter�"Been enjoying your movies over the years. Very entertaining. I feel like I've really gotten to know you over the years, most recently after watching you host Saturday Night Live. Great job. You continue to go for it. Proud of your work and look forward to meeting you. Steven Spielberg." 

# Whoa. 
It took me back to being just like a kid. I was so blown away. 

# In old clips of you wrestling, you have a line in the ring: "Rutherford B. Hayes, bitch!" It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard. 
There was a time in the WWE when it wasn't a publicly traded company. It was a great time. Because you flew under the radar. No one was covering it. We said whatever we wanted. My writer and I would challenge ourselves every night: What is the most insane, entertaining, fucked-up, crazy shit we can say tonight in an entertaining way? Maybe we could sing it; maybe we can say it in a
 nursery rhyme. "Rutherford B. Hayes, bitch!" 

# You used to say jabroni a lot in the ring. I love that word. 
When I was a kid, it was an inside term that guys would use. When wrestlers wanted to have a private conversation when fans were present, they would start talking carny because they used to wrestle in carnivals. I thought it was so cool. Jabroni was a word that was always used in the derogatory sense. Oh, this jabroni, that jabroni. But the Iron Sheik was famous for saying the word constantly backstage. Jabroni, jabroni, jabroni. Around 1998, I thought, Why can't I say it on TV? So I started saying it publicly, but the Iron Sheik was known for it. 

# You appear in The Sheik, the new documentary about the Iron Sheik. I didn't realize how influential he was. 
He was an incredible, world-renowned wrestler. He was a bodyguard for the shah of Iran. Incredible life. He was one of the guys who took me under his wing and bestowed some goooood knowledge. And one of the things that he told me was: "Keep your fucking mouth shut when you come in. If you're gonna be good in this business, then learn how to keep your mouth shut and your ears open, and when you get in the locker room, you just listen to everybody else." And it was great advice. You can apply it wherever you go.

# Hollywood, for instance. 
These young bucks come in and think they know everything when they really don't know shit. The best thing you can do is be quiet and open your ears. Let everybody else talk.

# Anything else you want to get off your chest?
Yeah. I've lived with my longtime girlfriend, Lauren Hashian, going on, like, eight, nine years now. She's a singer-songwriter. We spend a lot of time with my daughter in Florida, Simone, who's 13. We do these stories and we talk so much about the business end, the success end, but then Lauren isn't mentioned and my daughter isn't mentioned. I always like making sure we find the balance and my home life is in there and Lauren Hashian is in there and my daughter is in there. 

# Wise man.
You gotta get the better half in there. With all the cool shit and success that I've been lucky enough to get? That doesn't happen unless the home life is solid.

# You play an amputee in your latest movie, Skyscraper, so what’s the single biggest thing you learned during your research?
Oh man, it was inspiring, but the main thing I got from it is that we need to normalise disabilities. We need to get to a place where they are just totally looked past.

# What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?
My dad used to say that respect is given when it’s earned. But he hasn’t said that to me for a lot of years now, because he knows I live by that advice every day.

# Talking of failure—or its potential, at least—how confident were you that acting would work out for you post-WWE?
Well, I don’t think anybody was going to come up to me and say, “hey, we thought you were going to be terrible.” I just used the simple technique of making sure I’m always the hardest working person in the room. It doesn’t matter how much success my movies have, how many box office records they break, I will always be the hardest working person in the room.

#I was reading about Seven Bucks Productions [the company Johnson named after the amount of cash he had left after being let go from his Canadian Football League team]. Was that time pretty much all or nothing for you?
I think the ‘Seven Bucks moment’, if you want to call it that, was defining for me. I had been sulking on the sofa just watching trashy TV until that point. I decided there and then that, even if it wasn’t in football, the world was still going to hear from me. That’s pretty much where my wrestling career started. 

# What did you inherit from your dad?
I got his pure determination and will to succeed.

# So he’s a badass then?
My dad is the baddest of badasses – one of the most incredible human beings I know. He had a tough upbringing – and I mean real tough. His own father died when he was 13 years old, and just a few months later his mum moved her new boyfriend in. At Christmas that year the boyfriend got drunk and started acting up, so my Dad—who was still only 13 at the time—gave him a warning. Unfortunately, he didn’t listen, so, bang! my dad knocked him clean out. Long story short, the cops came and it resulted in him being homeless at just 13. So, yeah, he’s not a man you mess with. 
# Men's Health: How’s your day going?
Dwayne Johnson: Just got up with the babies; regardless of what time you go to bed, they’re up. I went to bed probably around 1:00, 1:30, as I normally do. Babies had me up at 6:00 A.m. I’ll go train [next].

# MH: Let’s start with Black Adam. What excited you about the role?
DJ: It’s been 15 years since we first started talking about Black Adam. It’s been seven years since we all agreed—Seven Bucks Productions and Warner Bros. and DC—that we were going to make Black Adam. What excited me about it was delivering a character in the superhero genre that had never been seen before. No actors had played Black Adam. In addition, but more important, is the opportunity to disrupt the superhero genre. You have a character like Black Adam, who is, depending on how you interpret his philosophies—is he a superhero, an antihero, or just a bad dude? Now, the difference is in Superman there’s a code of ethics that Superman abides by, which is why he is the greatest superhero. Superman won’t kill anyone. Black Adam, on the other hand, you can’t finish your sentence if you mean harm to him or his family.

# MH: Did you have any internal conflict about playing against public perception?
DJ: I’ve identified so deeply with Black Adam. . . . Yes, he lives in a gray area, but his philosophy is black-and-white. If you hurt the ones I love or my country, you’re going to pay. And there are no questions asked. There’s no bringing you to justice. There’s no apprehending you. You die. What also was very appealing to me, and I think will appeal to a lot of people, is that you can’t put him in a box and you can’t say, “You have to be like this. You can’t do this. You have to do that.” I felt like I experienced that throughout my career when I first got to Hollywood 20 years ago: “You can’t call yourself the Rock. You can’t talk about pro wrestling. You can’t be this big. You can’t work out as much. Change your diet. Lose weight. If you want to be like Will Smith, Johnny Depp, George Clooney, who were the stars at that time, this is how you have to be.” Well, I tried that on for a few years, and then finally I said, “Man, fuck this. I can’t be like that. I’m not those guys. I could never be those guys. I’m not in a box. Don’t tell me how to be. I’m going to be myself."

# MH: Did you have to train even harder to fill out the Black Adam costume?
DJ: We did. My goal was to bring in the best physique of my career, and that includes my years as a football player and as a pro wrestler. I’ve worked with Dave Rienzi, my trainer, very closely now for over a decade. The real challenge was to maintain that [physique] for months. It’s not All right. Go after it and grit and grind it out. No. You can’t do that, because your body can’t sustain it and your body will break down, whether you’re in your 20s or 60s. So we had to really approach it with care and science, and [Dave] was there throughout the shoot and constantly looking at my body, seeing how it’s coming along. How’s my sodium intake? How are the carbs? There’s just so much we have to look at.Now, what’s interesting is we could have said, “Fuck this—put the muscle pads in the suit,” as they normally do. And it’s not a knock to my friends at all, but I felt like, “Let’s be disruptive and let’s do it differently.” Let’s take all the muscle pads out, which we did, from Black Adam. When you have that suit on, every detail shows. Man, it was constant work, constant tweaking, tweaking, tweaking for months.

# MH: You turned 50 in May. How are you feeling about that?
DJ: There are markers you have in your life. As dudes, you hit your 30s, you like to think you’ve got your shit together. You generally have no fucking clue. You’re trying to work your shit out. And you’re trying to fake it till you make it, that kind of thing. You hit your 40s, hopefully you’re starting your family, you’re getting settled, feeling comfortable, and then you’re going through a lot in your 40s, too. I wanted to hit the fifth level in my rhythm and groove. What I mean by that is that my body was in a great place, that it wasn’t too banged up.So really, in my 30s and early 40s, when I was coming off of wrestling, I was still feeling the effects of all my wrestling injuries. At 40, I said, “Okay, I’m going to spend the next decade training as smart as I can, balancing out training and family and work, being an open sponge, learning every day but also not worrying about ego training, not worrying about the weight that I’m putting on the bar, pushing myself so hopefully, by the time I hit the fifth level, my joints are feeling great and I’m still able to not only maintain but add real muscle and some really dense muscle.” That’s a long answer to tell you I’m feeling pretty good.

# MH: Has your diet changed?
DJ: My philosophy is to eat clean and make sure that my diet is commensurate with my goals, which stay consistent throughout the year. It’s better to stay in shape than to get in shape. I am a real creature of habit. I usually eat the same thing every day for days and weeks and months. It’s very consistent. It’s very boring. It’s also extremely disciplined. That’s something I picked up from my old man, who was a hardcore gym fanatic. He taught me very early on not to eat to please the tongue but to eat to nourish the body. He taught me that when I was five. That’s probably why I need therapy.

# MH: What’s your breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
DJ: Well, I eat six meals a day [and they’re all similar in terms of nutrients]. Breakfast consists of eggs, a meat like bison, a complex carb like oatmeal, and fruit, usually either papaya or blueberries. My second meal, around 10:00 A.m., usually consists of a chicken breast, a complex carb like rice, and some greens. And dinner is fish or chicken, a complex carb like sweet potatoes, and some greens.

# MH: You count your macros, right?
DJ: In a very specific way, yes. I have a strength and conditioning coach. I have a nutritionist. I also have a lead chef advisor who speaks to a lot of the chefs I work with because I am often in different locations. So they work out all that math and they extrapolate. They’re much better and smarter at that than I am. I do see results quickly when we adjust the macros. [The range: protein 40–45 percent, carbs 40–50 percent, fats 15–20 percent.] We’ve got it down to a science where we fine-tune the macros and I never feel hungry. That’s a key: Training and dieting down for a goal requires discipline, and you can often feel hungry.

# MH: How has your training evolved?
DJ: I still train with the same intensity, but I’d like to think I train smarter. When I was 25, I was doing Olympic lifts, which are tough on the joints with the torque. I actually train shorter, but I get more out of it. What I’ve also been able to do with experience is listen to my body. You know, there’s a difference between the pain that you can work through—and that’s good to work through—and the pain where you have to stop what you’re doing and take care of that particular part of your body that’s hurt.

# MH: With great power comes . . . great responsibility. You have 340 million followers on Instagram craving your fitness content. Is that exhausting?
DJ: It’s a blessing. I have trained long enough to know that there are some good takeaways that I could share that could help my audience in their fitness and wellness journey. One of the responsibilities, though, is to make sure that the things I’m posting are smart, training-wise—not dumb shit that’ll get you hurt. Guys do that all the time, and they train out of ego and they train to get views and you see them doing crazy exercises. Some are very entertaining, but some are pretty dangerous, too. I think it’s really important to make sure that you don’t lose the integrity of why you’re in the gym to begin with. You’re in the gym to build your muscles or whatever your goal is. Usually when I do post training, it’s toward the end of my workout or my final set. I don’t do anything in between. I get in the gym and I don’t fuck around.

# MH: Training isn’t just about physical strength. How does it affect you mentally?
DJ: Psychological nourishment. I really feel that there are fundamental skills that you learn in the gym in terms of discipline, working through your fatigue, pushing past what you perceive as a limit. ’Cause there’s greatness on the other side. There are little achievements along the way that you’re gonna gain from your training. Big achievements, too.

# MH: You’ve experienced depression. Does training help manage that?
DJ: I think so, sure. During those times when I fell into and was challenged by depression, the gym became my best friend—and I know it’s like that for a lot of people. You’re able to go to the gym to sweat out toxins and get a little bit more clarity when you walk out the door. It doesn’t fix the problem, but it helps.

# MH: Over the past few years, you’ve opened up more about your spirituality and mana. How does that help you?
DJ: So I’m half Black and half Samoan. And on the Samoan side, there’s a Polynesian word called mana. Really what it means is like an energy, a force, a power that we all have, and it’s ever existent in our world. When I talk about mana, it’s a feeling that I get that’s just here deep in the DNA, and you can get it when you walk into the gym. You can feel the mana. It can be quite palpable.

# MH: Is that something that you try to tap into daily or you just feel it?
DJ: For me, mana becomes my daily anchor, and it’s a reminder of my cultures. It’s a reminder of who I am; and it’s a reminder to work hard, to be humble, to show gratitude; and it’s a reminder to always connect with people, like we could be connected through mana. It’s very powerful.

# MH: Do you feel like you’re connecting with your spiritual side more now?
DJ: Well, I’ve always been connected to my cultures, my family, and my ancestors. But as you go down the road of life, you start to get more connected with your spirituality in that kind of way where you start to realize what mana actually means, you know?

# MH: Does anything scare you?
DJ: The thing that keeps me up at night is just how everything shakes out, the things we have planned, the things I can control. Making the right moves, thinking about my family, my babies, all the other stuff that’s going on. Once I get everybody to bed, there’s a window of about two hours when the whole house is quiet where I do most of my thinking and where I can accomplish most of my thoughts from beginning to end. Then I can go to sleep with usually some clarity. Tequila helps, too.

# MH: You have a lot going on. How do you prioritize and find balance?
DJ: I prioritize things by asking, Do I love them? Am I passionate about them? They could be big things, they could be little things, but either way, whatever they are, if they don’t get me out of bed and if I’m not running toward those things, then I don’t do them. That’s how I prioritize things. How I find balance is by making sure that I still remain in touch with the simple core things that are important to me. Life can get crazy and funny for all of us, but especially when you get a little bit of fame, things have a tendency to go sideways. So I like doing simple core things that keep the stability.

# MH: Communication is really important, too, right?
DJ: Oh, man, I think one of the defining, seminal moments in my life was when I really realized the power and the value of asking for help. Vulnerability. You know, really kind of checking your ego at the door. As guys, we have a tendency to not ask for help. Ego gets in the way, and we start stuffing things deep down in our guts, which is not a good thing. I’ve become an advocate for asking for help. And it wasn’t always like that, and it’s much easier said than done. I grew up an only child. I was that guy who would stuff things down and not talk about them, and I’d figure it out all by myself. Most of the time I did figure it out all by myself, but also it just took a toll, man, on my soul and on my mental health. So these days, I’m a big advocate for asking for help. Also, I’ve lost friends, uh, who checked out and, yeah, ended their lives because they didn’t want to ask for help. Yeah. So you gotta communicate. You gotta ask for help. There’s no shame in that. If you don’t know something, ask. If you don’t know, ask.

# Mr. Johnson, you've appeared in countless films over the course of your career, and you're often called the "hardest working man in Hollywood." Are you happiest when you're working?
I enjoy working, I enjoy building; I have a little philosophy that I enjoy putting in the work with my own two hands� I like saying that. Making a movie and producing a movie, especially one that you are lucky enough to star in, comes with a great deal of joy, an incredible amount of hard work and equal amounts of stress, pressure, fun, and anxiety. But ultimately it's extremely rewarding! I have the best job in the world.

# How do you decide when to say yes to a film project, and when it might be too stressful for you?
Well, the appealing things about making, for example,Red Notice, were the following: the opportunity to make a movie that was fun, globetrotting, working with my friends Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot� Rawson Thurber, the director, this was our third movie together, and I loved that this was stylistic and different with a really cool twist. Creating a movie that hundreds of millions of people will see on opening weekend thanks to Netflix; of course the idea of that is pretty exciting!

# Do you ever think about slowing down?
I will tell you, as I get a little older, I start to realize more and more how important balance is, how important mindfulness is. And I really try to practice that with all the things that I have going on. I think that has allowed me to bring in a lot more people who are smarter and better than me at what they do, so they can help push the businesses along.

# It's so crucial to find a balance, otherwise the constant work can start to wear you down.
I do try to find that balance! It's really important to make sure that the wellness part is taken care of! At the same time, I do like activity and I do like movement; I like energy and action. And I like getting up in the morning with the sun � sometimes I can beat the sun up! Not that I am in competition with the sun, because otherwise I would need therapy! (Laughs) But I do like kick starting my day. Fitness has always been a part of my lifestyle.

# Indeed, I think I saw an Instagram post of you working out just before this interview.
(Laughs) Even when I was a little kid, my dad would take me to the gym at a very young age! I think we all, at some degree, get up and we move and we are working out, whether we are intensely working out or doing a little bit of cardio, whatever that is, everyone does their version of sweat equity. Wellness is a part of that, and it is so incredibly important.

# Is wellness also part of your duty as role model? More so than other celebrities, people really look up to you, and there is a certain responsibility that comes with that.
Sure, it comes with the game. As you get a little bit of fame or a little bit of notoriety, whether that be on a football field, a soccer field, a wrestling ring, on the big screen, on stage, whatever it is that you do, I've always felt that that responsibility just comes with the game. I remember very early, even when I was playing college football, I accepted that role. I guess as I got a little bit older and achieved what I've been fortunate enough to achieve, I do feel it's really important to not only be the best example that I can be� But in that spirit, I also believe in sharing the good stuff. The good positive optimistic stuff ultimately is the most important thing. There is a real energy behind that. And I have found that sharing the wins, the successes will make people feel good and you've got a real shot at maybe motivating and maybe inspiring some people along the way.

# Is it also important to share the bad stuff, the failures? You've been very open about your road to success; coming from football, when you had nothing but seven dollars in your pocket?
Yeah, that was in 1995 and that will always serve as my north star and drive, for sure. I think we all go through our "seven bucks moments," and I remember thinking at that time that I was tired of being broke and I would do anything to change my situation, to help and take care of my family. The only thing that I could do was control my effort and put in the work with my own two hands! Sharing those kinds of lessons, the harder times and the times where you do get your ass kicked, the times you don't win, job loss, life loss, love loss� It's important to share some of that too, being in my position, especially the lessons that that may help a few people along the way.

# What have you grappled with recently that has provided a similar lesson?
Well, a few years ago, I had a reached a lower point than normal in my life. I was struggling with something that was within the family and it really set me back. I was going through it! I have a tendency to keep things very close to the sleeve, I think because I was an only child growing up and I'm used to not really communicating my feelings, you know? To express my emotions right out of the gate was something that never came easy to me, even these days! So I did have to overcome that, it took me maybe about a month or two to kind of overcome that, get through the sludge of that.

# What do you think helped you the most during that time?
At that time, I had work to help ease the strain, I had some loved ones at that time who were really wonderful. Even though I am not saying exactly what I was going through back then, I know that we all go through it, somy recommendation is to talk about it. And that's so much easier said than done. But the faster you can talk about it, then the faster you get, not only to the other side of it, but also then you start to sharpen your toolbox in terms of your skills and how equipped you are to deal with things like that.If you are going through it, if you are feeling low, if you are feeling down, wondering why is all this shit happening� Let's try and figure it out. Try your best to talk about it and not keep it in, because I have been down that road where you keep shit in, it's not a good place to be.

# You've seen some great successes, any highlights? Reflecting back, anything you wish you would have done differently?
"I worked hard, had some luck on my side and was able to accomplish a few things in 2021. A few highlights that come to mind, one would be completing two massive Seven Bucks Productions films, �Red Notice' and �Black Adam.' (Set for release in 2022.) Both presented a lot of challenges during Covid, but like so many businesses out there, we adjust, get clarity, create our new Covid strategy and get to work. Seven Bucks also just completed � two weeks ago � our second season of NBC's �Young Rock.' I'm quite proud of everyone's efforts and talents to get the job done and deliver quality. And the other businesses in my portfolio have shown tremendous growth and moved along nicely in 2021 � Teremana Tequila, ZOA Energy, Project Rock and XFL. As for anything I would've done differently in 2021, sure, I would've listened to my gut when it was telling me to slow down a bit. Enjoy these moments even more with your family and friends, because at the end of the day these joyful moments are the s*** that really matters in life. Sorry to cuss but that's the truth. Good lesson to always listen to that voice in your gut."

# "Red Notice" received an enormous amount of praise, from both those in the industry and with audiences worldwide by becoming Netflix's most watched movie in the world for 2021, and most watched of all time. What do you think made "Red Notice" so successful?
"First thing, we made a great movie for families around the world to enjoy. That's the bottom line. Deliver the goods. I always say I can bring people to the dance and with the trust they have in me, they'll dance one song. But then it's up to the quality I'm offering that will make them dance all night.  We made a great movie and people are dancing to it. Rawson Thurber did a tremendous job of writing and directing �Red Notice' that attracted two of the biggest stars in the world, in Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, and a dude who's only famous for his tattoos, raised eyebrow and a fanny pack. But dumb jokes aside, it's a monumental achievement for our Seven Bucks Productions to produce the most watched Netflix film of all time. �Red Notice' was my first film on a streaming platform so it was critically important for myself and our Seven Bucks Company to deliver and move the streaming needle. What a holy s*** achievement and congrats to everyone involved."

# What are your thoughts on the streaming wars among platforms and its impact on theatrical releases, does this play a part when discussing releases for your projects as a producer?
"I say this with great clarity, we are in a tremendous time in our Hollywood industry as we are in the eye of a massive opportunity to listen and learn what our audience and our consumers want and just as important, how they want it. I believe strongly in our theatrical business and want us to continue to work hard to maintain that theatrical experience for our consumers. When a movie is done right, man it's pure magic in the theaters. And I also feel strongly that it's our job as creators, producers and deliverers of entertainment to always take care of and go to the people. I try and approach streaming platforms versus theatrical with an entrepreneurial spirit and vision. The power of possibilities and the needs of the audience, consumers first, best practice will emerge. We just have to be smart, open and flexible to change and listen to what the people say they want."

# There was a lot of buzz that you may rejoin the "Fast and the Furious" franchise. We saw that Vin Diesel recently posted he wants you back. We know you addressed potentially returning months ago, but were you surprised by Vin's post?
"I was very surprised by Vin's recent post. This past June, when Vin and I actually connected not over social media, I told him directly - and privately - that I would not be returning to the franchise. I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return. I privately spoke with my partners at Universal as well, all of whom were very supportive as they understand the problem. Vin's recent public post was an example of his manipulation. I didn't like that he brought up his children in the post, as well as Paul Walker's death. Leave them out of it. We had spoken months ago about this and came to a clear understanding. My goal all along was to end my amazing journey with this incredible �Fast & Furious' franchise with gratitude and grace. It's unfortunate that this public dialogue has muddied the waters. Regardless, I'm confident in the �Fast' universe and its ability to consistently deliver for the audience, and I truly wish my former co-stars and crew members the best of luck and success in the next chapter."


# As the most followed American man on Instagram, do you think anything has changed with how you have approached your own social media this past year?
"That answer is yes. I still have my anchoring guidelines I follow: Be authentic, be real and try to make sure every social post has a quality and meaning behind it, offering some takeaway for people and being aware about never wasting anyone's time with a bulls***post about nothing. But I'll tell you, as we navigate our way through Covid's harsh ebbs and flows, I've found myself trying to use a much lighter touch with my words since things on social media are so easily triggering these days, clickbait stuff.  Lighter touch and quality I try to use daily when connecting with people through social media. And if I can make you laugh and smile, I'll try and do that too."

# Was becoming a tequila mogul always part of the plan? What's next for Teremana in 2022 and beyond?
"Tequila mogul was not part of the initial strategy, but I'll sure take it. Our numbers were disclosed earlier this week and our Teremana growth is truly unprecedented. Our sales have exceeded over 600,000 nine-liter cases and in our spirits industry, that's an all-time record for first year sales. For context, George Clooney sold his Casamigos tequila brand to Diageo for $1 billion dollars and they were selling approximately 170,000 cases.  Teremana is currently selling over 600,000 cases. So you can extrapolate the math and valuation, astounding growth and I think it reflects our �highest in quality and best in taste' mantra. I'm happy but not satisfied with what we've been able to accomplish with Teremana tequila thus far. The work is just beginning. My goal for 2022 and beyond is to make Teremana a true international tequila brand. We have the organization and international distribution expertise with our Mast-Jaegermeister partners, our Teremana team and just as important, we have the ambition and work ethic. "

# You've said in the past, I believe specifically in your interview for your recentVanity Faircover, that you would not run for President in 2024 because you "don't know a thing about politics." Yet,according to a poll this spring, almost half of Americans would vote in your favor. Could "The Rock" still be a potential presidential candidate in the future?
"Well, I think that poll of almost half of Americans being in favor of me running for president is so humbling. It sits me down and I don't know any other way to describe it. To have a little ability to potentially galvanize our country is humbling, very humbling. Might be the Teremana talking here but I still don't know a damn thing about being a politician. I don't know if I have that politician gene in my DNA. Leader? Yes. Patriot? All day long. Politician? No.I feel the best position I can be in right now is to be a trusted, nonjudgmental place for people; regardless of what side of the street you live on, what color you are, what you do for a living, how you choose to live your life, what your bank account says, whether you drive a car or take the bus. I don’t care. None of that matters to me. Just work hard, take care of your family, be good to people, be kind to people, be straight up, honor your word and always [have] some fun along the way. And don’t be an asshole. Like I said, I don’t think I’d make a good politician

# Do you have a New Year's goal or resolution?
To be honest, I usually don’t have New Year’s resolutions. I know I sound like an asshole here but I’m the guy who usually just does it throughout the year. Whatever change needs to happen, I’ll get it done and move on. But this past year has been different. It’s opened my eyes a bit more to real change that needs to my attention. Work flow, work stream, what and who in my life really need my attention, what truly should be getting me out of bed. I’ve reached a point in my life this past year where I realized just how vital the idea and essence of time is; who and what gets my time these days. We don’t get time back, so in 2022 and beyond, the people, the projects, the energy, the everything. Life. If it gets my time and gets me out of bed, then I’ll go to sleep knowing it was worth it and it was all time wisely spent. Time is our greatest and most valuable currency.

# Q: Teremana Tequila has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing the one-million-case mark in annual sales. How does it feel to have reached this achievement, and what does it mean for the brand?

A: Teremana Tequila's journey has been remarkable. The fact that we've hit the one-million-case mark in annual sales is beyond our expectations and truly historic. Out of the many tequila brands available, only 10 others can boast higher sales numbers. Among them is Casamigos, which had a major sale to Diageo a few years ago. When Casamigos sold, they were only moving 120,000 cases per year. So, for us, this achievement is a major deal and a testament to Teremana's exceptional quality, taste, and affordability.

# Q: Teremana Tequila has received recognition from numerous international spirits awards. Could you share more about the brand's journey to success and how it stands out in the market?

A: Teremana Tequila has been honored with 17 top international spirits awards, which is a testament to the brand's excellence.

Our decision to partner with the Lopez family, a well-established name in the tequila industry, has definitely contributed to our quality and success.

This growth is especially evident in the super premium segment, where Teremana positions itself at an accessible price point of $30 a bottle. The timing of Teremana's launch aligns with this tequila boom, contributing to our success.

# Q: Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Teremana Tequila has achieved remarkable success. Can you share your thoughts on how the launch happened during COVID-19 and how you managed to navigate the uncertainties?

A: Launching Teremana Tequila at the start of the pandemic was a bold move, considering the uncertain consumer behavior during that time. However, we didn't want to shelve our product; instead, we believed there was an opportunity because we were all in this together. While people were seeking familiarity, we decided to offer something new. It was a risk, but it paid off.

# Q: Your social media presence, with over 328 million Instagram followers, is substantial. How did your engagement on social media help with Teremana Tequila's messaging and success?

A: Social media has been a powerful tool for me to connect with fans around the world. I've built trust equity with my followers, and I knew I had a chance to make an impact. So, I shared my experience of having a drink and let the response unfold naturally. The result was the achievement of one million cases in annual sales—a testament to the connection I have with my audience.

# Q: With the achievement of one million cases in annual sales, what are your thoughts on Teremana Tequila's journey and its future?

A: Achieving one million cases in annual sales is a source of immense gratitude for me. Our goal was to introduce a brand that people would love, and we took the time to showcase its quality and authenticity. Teremana is not just about promoting or marketing; it's about establishing a genuine relationship with our consumers. Looking ahead, my vision for Teremana is not centered on a short-term exit strategy but rather building a legacy brand that stands the test of time.

# Q: Some of your peers in the tequila business, like Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg, have pursued exit strategies. What sets your approach with Teremana apart?

A: I'm in it for the long haul. Teremana Tequila is a legacy brand, and my commitment extends far beyond five years. While others may have different business models and exit strategies, my focus is on building a lasting brand that resonates globally. I wish them success in their endeavors, but for me, Teremana's journey is about creating a timeless legacy.

# Q: Looking to the future, what are your plans for Teremana Tequila on a global scale?

A: Our immediate focus is on strengthening our domestic presence and enhancing our on-premise business. Simultaneously, we're working on internationalizing the Teremana Tequila brand to make it a true global player. The goal is to establish Teremana as a recognized and respected tequila brand worldwide, maintaining the quality and authenticity that define our identity.

#Q: How does Dwayne Johnson feel about his role as Black Adam in the DC Comics Universe?

A: Well, there's a few things. The plan is to continue building up these companies in every sector—film, television, digital, maybe even music. There's a little tease there.

A: It's true that I have many ventures and a busy schedule, and yes, sometimes it can be tiring. But I've reached a point in my life where if something truly excites me and motivates me to get out of bed, I go for it. I've learned to surround myself with smart people who can handle different aspects of my ventures, allowing me to focus on what I do best.

#Q: How did Dwayne Johnson's career transition from wrestling to acting?
A: After wrestling, I transitioned to acting in the mid-2000s. Initially, Hollywood wanted me to conform to a typical leading man image, which didn't feel right.

#Q: How has your relationship with your father influenced your grieving process?
A: My relationship with my dad was complicated, built on tough love. Despite that, what gave me satisfaction at the funeral was seeing how he was a great friend to many. It was a reminder that our relationships are complex and evolve over time.

#Q: How does your perception of success now compare to what you imagined as a kid?
A: As a kid, I never envisioned this level of success or fame. I did have a gut feeling that the world would hear from me in some way. But it's not exactly what I imagined; it's been a surreal journey, almost like being in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

#Q: What did you first splurge on when you realized you had enough to do so?
A: When I was a teenager, around 14, I thought success meant having a Rolex watch. So, when I started making some money, I bought a Rolex. However, a wrestling match mishap destroyed it on live TV. I took it as a sign and realized that material possessions aren't the essence of success. From then on, I've been more focused on investments and properties.

#Q: Can you share how you turned a negative crowd reaction into a turning point in your career?
A: Absolutely. At WrestleMania 13, the crowd chanted "rocky sucks" when I was supposed to be a good guy. This pivotal moment made me realize that I needed to be authentic and true to myself. So, I asked for permission to be myself on live TV, and it marked a defining shift in my career. I became "The Rock" from that point forward and never looked back.

#Q: What led you to name your company "Seven Bucks"?
A: The name "Seven Bucks" originates from a time when I had only seven dollars in my wallet. I wanted to buy my parents a house, but my dreams of playing professional football didn't materialize. That moment of having just seven dollars stayed with me, and I now run a company named "Seven Bucks Productions" to remind myself of that journey.

#Q: How do you view challenges and setbacks in your life?

Embrace challenges and remember that success starts with scratching and clawing your way toward your dreams.

#Q: Tina Fey joked about starting a new society with you. Are you on board?
A: Haha, that was hilarious. In the spirit of nurturing and caring for the human race, I would have to consult with my wife, Lauren, on that matter. She's the boss when it comes to such decisions.

#Q: In a changing landscape of masculinity, you seem comfortable with your softer side. How did this evolve?
A: The evolution of being comfortable with my softer side has been a learning experience, especially since becoming a father to my daughters. It's about continuous growth, managing emotions, and understanding the power of empathy. I've learned the importance of communicating openly about feelings and fears, and that includes self-empathy.

#Q: Did therapy play a role in this transformation?
A: Yes, therapy played a significant role in helping me become the man I wanted to be. It taught me that I'm not alone in dealing with mental struggles and that communication, vulnerability, and empathy are essential. Therapy helped me manage my depression and become more in touch with my emotions.

A: Lauren has been a positive influence on my life. She keeps me grounded and helps me handle the pressures of fame. Our relationship is a true partnership that promotes growth and support.

#Q: You got married very early in the morning. What inspired that choice?
A: Our early morning wedding was a conscious choice due to the time difference in Hawaii, where we got married. It allowed us to have an intimate ceremony with only a few close family members and friends present.

#Q: In your downtime, what do you and Lauren enjoy doing?
A: When we're not in the spotlight, Lauren and I love spending time with our daughters, engaging in outdoor activities like fishing. I have a genuine country boy spirit, and I enjoy fishing, particularly on our properties.

#Q: What advice do you have for men to create stronger relationships with their partners?
A: To foster stronger relationships, I would advise men to become attentive listeners. Communication and empathy are key. Being a good listener helps you understand your partner better and deepens your connection.

#Q: What continues to surprise you the most about people?
A: One thing that gives me comfort and makes me feel good is witnessing the inherent kindness and goodness that people possess. It's heartening to see the compassion and positive aspects of humanity.

#Q: In today's world, there's a lot of negativity, but you believe people are good at heart. What surprises you most about people?
A: What still surprises me about people is that despite all the negativity and pessimism around, there's a magnification of goodness in them. The majority of people are good-hearted, and I truly believe in that.

#Q: You mentioned getting wide-eyed at things despite your experience. What still surprises you about yourself?
A: About myself, what surprises me most is that even though I've been through so much and had my fair share of experiences, I still find myself getting genuinely excited and wide-eyed, especially at the little things that bring joy.

#Q: Finish this sentence: I'd never miss a movie if...
A: I'd never miss a movie if Tom Hanks was in it. 100%, no doubt.

#Q: Any particular roles or genres you'd like to explore in the future?
A: I've always wanted to do a musical. Music is something I love, and I had a taste of it when I worked on Moana with Lin-Manuel Miranda. So, a musical would be something I'd love to tackle someday.

#Q: People have suggested that you and Oprah could run for office. What are your thoughts on that?
A: Haha, that's an interesting idea. Well, Oprah, I'd be your vice any day, and I'm sure you'd make a fantastic president. The thought of it does bring a smile.

#Q: Do you set goals and have a vision for the future?
A: Yes, I do set goals and have a vision for the future. I believe in consistency, so even throughout the year, I work on setting and achieving goals. Recently, with the passing of my dad, my focus has shifted to appreciating life, being present in the moment, and valuing my family and connections even more.

#Q: What's the purest intention behind your endeavors, like building Seven Bucks Productions?
A: The purest intention behind everything I do, including building Seven Bucks Productions, is to create amazing experiences for people. I want to bring joy, transform lives, and provide a positive impact through my work. The audience's experience is paramount to me.

#Q: You've stressed the importance of being authentic. How has being true to yourself impacted your journey?
